    "R00003": "For a number of years, there have been concerns that climate change negotiations will essentially ignore a key principle of climate change negotiation frameworks: the common but differentiated responsibilities. Realizing that greenhouse emissions remain in the atmosphere for a very long time, this principle recognizes that historically: Industrialized nations have emitted far more greenhouse gas emissions (even if some developing nations are only now increasing theirs); Rich countries therefore face the biggest responsibility and burden for action to address climate change; and Rich countries therefore must support developing nations adaptthrough financing and technology transfer, for example.  This notion of climate justice is typically ignored by many rich nations and their mainstream media, making it easy to blame China, India and other developing countries for failures in climate change mitigation negotiations.  Development expert, Martin Khor, calculated that taking historical emissions into account, the rich countries owe a carbon debt because they have already used more than their fair quota of emissions. Now, the mainstream is generally worried about climate change impacts and the discourse seems to have shifted accordingly. Some businesses that once engaged in disinformation campaigns have even changed their opinions, some even requesting governments for regulation and direction on this issue.  However, a few influential companies and organizations are still attempting to undermine climate change action and concerns.  Will all this mean a different type of spin and propaganda with attempts at green washing and misleading information becoming the norm, or will there now be",
    "R00004": "Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called highly climate vulnerable) due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the worlds poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010  4% in the Pacific  with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.  For example, with regards to health risks, they commonly have: low levels of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene; energy poverty; high levels",

Frustino/Associated Press International Agreements on Climate Change The Paris Agreement is the culmination of decades of international efforts to combat climate change.  Here is a brief history.  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change In 1992, President George H.W. Bush joined 107 other heads of state at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil to adopt a series of environmental agreements, including the UNFCCC framework that remains in effect today.  The international treaty aimed to prevent dangerous human interference with earths climate systems over the long term.  The pact set no limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contained no enforcement mechanisms, but instead established a framework for international negotiations of future agreements, or protocols, to set binding emissions targets.  Participating countries meet annually at a Conference of the Parties (COP) to assess their progress and continue talks on how to best tackle climate change.  Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol, a landmark environmental treaty that was adopted in 1997 at the COP 3 in Japan, represents the first time nations agreed to legally mandated, country-specific emissions reduction targets.

Vigan said that Catholic bishops who support George Floyd protests associated with Black Lives Matter, were aligned with the New World Order conspiracy.  and that they invoked the Masonic universal brotherhoodalso part of the new world order plot.  He described the protests and the COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns as a Biblical struggle between light and dark, urging President Trump to fight against the deep state in the United States, which included responding to the protests.  Vigan alleged that the protests were organized by now President Joe Biden who embodies the deep state goals.

The president faces impeachment for manipulating Ukraine policy to serve his political purposes.  Chaos reigns in Syria following Trumps schizophrenic withdrawal announcements.  The administration has offered scant support for Hong Kong protesters.  And international distrust of the United States is at an all-time high.  Amid all this, Bidens team is betting Americans are ready for a return to foreign policy run by professionals.  Biden knows world leaders personally, knows the issues and is in the best position to fix the damage Trump has inflicted on U.S. international standing and influence, Blinken said.  Biden is also running on a defense of U.S. values, something those who are endorsing him today also believe to be crucial.

If you dont want to make any improvements to your physique, then the best way to achieve that goal is to never progress in the gym.  Albert Einstein put it best:  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.   However, if you want to see visible changes in your body, youll need to go into the gym with the attitude that youre going to be better than yesterday.  The most tangible way to progress is to simply challenge yourself with heavier weights.  For example, maybe last week on Chest Day you were able to bench 185lbs for 10 reps.  Then the next time you train chest, you should aim to perform 190lbs for 10 reps.  The great thing about progression is that it keeps you motivated!  Even if youre not lifting heavier weights, you can increase the number of reps you complete, sets to perform, and many other variables.  All of those are still ways to progress.  The main thing is that you dont simply repeat what you were doing last week.

This being said, its the focus of many other types of fitness enthusiasts.  AMRAP exercises get your heart rate a lot higher than traditional lifting, which means that alongside improving your cardiovascular system, they burn calories.  This is good if your goal is to lose weight or become healthier overall, but its not great if youre trying to put on muscle.

Then, we compared this to a handful of other activities.  (Note that you might not do these activities for a full hour, but we used one hour as a standard means of comparison.)  What you'll find is that the big calorie burners on the list have a few things in common: They use a lot of muscles throughout the body, and they can be really challenging.  Here are some exercises you might want to add to your routine if you're trying to burn more calories: 1.  Indoor cycling: Approximately 952 calories per hour McCall notes that intensity should be at 200 watts or greater.  If the stationary bike doesn't display watts: This means when your indoor cycling instructor tells you to turn up the resistance, you do it!  he says.  2  . Cross-country skiing: Approximately 850 calories per hour This all depends on your experience as a skier.  Slow, light effort won't burn nearly as many calories as a brisk-speed, vigorous effort will.  To really challenge yourself and burn up energy?  Try uphill skiing.  3  .

    "R00024": "Rowing: Approximately 816 calories per hour Again, 200 watts is the benchmark here; McCall says it should be at a vigorous effort. Many rowing machines list watts on the display.  Bonus: Rowing is an incredible back workout too.  4.  Jumping rope: Approximately 802 calories per hour This should be at a moderate paceapproximately 100 skips per minuteMcCall says.  Try this jump-rope interval workout to get started.  5. Kickboxing: Approximately 700 calories per hour Other types of martial arts, like Muay Thai, fit into this category too.  When it comes to regular boxing, the biggest calorie burn comes when you're legit in the ring (a.k.a.  fighting another person).  But a lot of boxing classes also incorporate cardio exercises like mountain climbers and burpees, so your heart rate ends up increasing more than you'd expect.  And, hey, you've gotta start somewhere before you can get into the ring, right?  6.  Swimming: Approximately 680 calories per hour Freestyle works, but you should aim for a vigorous 75 yards per minute pace, McCall says.  This is a little aggressive for a casual swimmer.  (Butterfly stroke is even more effective if you feel like getting fancy.) 7.  Burning Calories If your goal of jumping rope is to burn as many calories as possible, skip as long as you can without becoming overly sore after the workout or the following day.

While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.

    "R00029": "Thats why you often hear that fasted cardio is better for fat loss because your glycogen stores are depleted when you work out. When you dont have carbs readily available as a fuel source for your muscles, theyre forced to burn fat.  While this can be an effective strategy for fat loss, the lack of carbs may limit the intensity with which you can work out, so youre burning fewer calories overall.  Fasted cardio works best for a longer duration, low to moderate-intensity exercise and not so well for high-intensity training.  So, plan what you eat based on how intensely and how long you intend to train.  Degree of Training As you become well trained, your body becomes more efficient at oxidizing fat as a fuel source.  Therefore, youll use a slightly higher ratio of fat to carbohydrates during moderate to moderately-high exercise intensities.  Your body essentially learns to tap into fat more effectively and spare glycogen.  Thats one of the benefits of training.  Gender Studies show that women derive a higher ratio of fats relative to carbohydrates during low to moderate intensity exercise compared to men.

    "R00032": "In June 1972, Nixon authorized members of his secret unit, as well as CREEP, to pay a team of burglars to infiltrate the Democratic Party's headquarters at the Watergate complex. This was prior to the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents.  These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire-taps and recording equipment.  Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted.  As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested.  The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders.  Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security.  The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.  By January 1973, the Watergate intruders stood trial for their participation in the break-in. Watergate burglars arrested, June 17, 1972 - POLITICO On this day in 1972, five men were apprehended while breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate, an office-hotel-apartment complex near the Potomac.

Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event.  Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse.  John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors.  When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders.  In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in.  The dominoes were now falling one by one.  In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate.  Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up.  Simultaneously, the one piece of evidence that Congress, as well as the federal prosecution, needed was Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office. In January 1973, the same month in which President Nixon began his second term, the burglars each went on trial separately before U.S. District Judge John Sirica; all pleaded or were found guilty. That February, the United States Senate voted to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal.  The resultant",

Judge Sirica and Congress both refused the compromise and instead sent special prosecutor for the case, Archibald Cox, to present Nixon with a subpoena for the tapes.  In another outlandish move, Nixon used his executive powers to terminate Cox as a prosecutor in what became known as the ' Saturday Night Massacre .'  Nixon Surrenders Nixon's intransigence and outright defiance failed to pay off.  While Nixon attempted to release sanitized versions of his tapes, many had had enough.  On July 24, 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of U.S. v. Nixon that Nixon's use of executive privilege was not applicable in a criminal investigation.  Within weeks of the decision, the House of Representatives approved the impeachment of Nixon on the grounds of obstruction of justice, violation of the constitution and the unlawful withholding of evidence.  To make matters worse, a tape was released, known as the 'smoking gun,' which unveiled Nixon agreeing to a CIA cover-up of the Watergate break-in during a phone conversation in 1972.

Notably, his successor, President Gerald Ford, pardoned Nixon for his involvement in Watergate soon after his resignation.  Lesson Summary President Richard Nixon's well-known paranoia caused him to make irrational decisions which cost him the presidency.  The litmus test for his instability was his handling of the ' Pentagon Papers ' and his involvement in the break-in and subsequent cover-up at the Watergate complex.  Nixon created a secret intelligence team to provide him with constant information on his friends and adversaries.  This intelligence team, which became known as the 'plumbers,' attempted to stop Daniel Ellsberg's leak of confidential information concerning American involvement in the Vietnam War to the media.  While this was a major abuse of executive power, the Watergate Scandal was far worse.  Nixon's powerful victory over George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election was tainted by his actions.  In order to gain an inside edge on his political opponents, Nixon authorized an intelligence team and members of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) to fund the burglary of the Democratic National headquarters at the Watergate complex.  The intruders, however, failed to set the surveillance equipment up properly. In a statement accompanying the release of the tapes on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of the truth behind the Watergate break-in,",

The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many science fiction stories and films.   Section::::Origins.   There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion.

Agrippa's Trilemma is the proposition that the attempt to justify any philosophical belief can only end in one of three ways: 1)  A circular argument 2)  An infinite chain of explanation 3) A foundational assumption that can no longer be questioned An implicit point behind the Trilemma is that all of these ends are rather terrible, in the sense that they don't offer any satisfying finality.  I am neither defending nor rejecting the Trilemma here, but I do want to know if you think it applies in any way to the philosophical issues below.

Local informants were reported to have started British curiosity regarding the origins of the Taj by also supplying them with fictitious lists of workmen and materials from all over Asia.

Louis J. Perlman Lou Perlman, the manager of such singing sensations as the Backstreet Boys.  and NSync, conducted a $500 million dollar Ponzi scheme.  In 2006, it was discovered that Pearlman was the head of one of the largest and longest running Ponzi schemes in American history, leaving almost half a billion dollars in debts.  Perlman headed up Transcontinental Airlines Travel Services Inc. and Transcontinental Airlines Inc., and the Transcontinental Savings Program (collectively referred to as Transcontinental), which existed only on paper. Authorities (or sometimes whistleblowers on the inside) find out about the scheme and stop it. The scheme was named after a man named Charles Ponzi.  He used the scheme after moving from Italy to the United States in 1903.  (Ponzi didn't invent the scheme,",

Excuses are given regarding why clients cannot review information in writing about an investment.  Also, account statement errors and inconsistencies are frequently signs that funds are not being invested as promised.   BULLET::::- Difficulty receiving payments.  Clients have failures to receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out their investments.  Ponzi scheme promoters routinely encourage participants to roll over investments and sometimes promise even higher returns on the amount rolled over.   Section::::Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme.   If a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities, it usually falls apart for one of the following reasons:  BULLET::::1.  The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money.   BULLET::::2.  Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).  Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.   BULLET::::3.

    "R00073": "Similar schemes A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a hub for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.  A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.  A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.  By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.  Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes.  For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method, known as  smart Ponzis  per the Financial Times.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of",

The capital of Argentina is Buenos Aires, which is located along the southeastern shore of South America, along the Rio de la Plata.  This city has a population size of 3.89 million and a metropolitan population of around 17 million, making it the largest city in the country and fourth-largest city in the western hemisphere.  This city is known for its high quality of life.  For example, residents of Buenos Aires have one of the highest household income levels in South America.  Additionally, this capital city is is popular with tourists, who come to take in the multicultural scene and European-influenced architecture.  History of the Capital of Argentina Present-day Buenos Aires was inhabited by indigenous peoples until Spanish explorers founded the city in 1536.  The native inhabitants defended their homes and forced the European settlers out of the region by 1542.  Nearly 40 years later, Spanish colonizers returned and established a trading post.  Traders of the time, however, were penalized by the complexity of the approved trading routes (which benefitted Lima, Peru) and by the later part of the 19th century, began to promote the idea of independence from the Spanish crown.

The most popular type of pastry is said to be that of medialunas (singular: medialuna, literally half-moon, that is to say, crescent), based upon French croissants.  Furthermore, sandwiches de miga are another type of bread products; they are made only with thin layers of white bread (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from ham and cheese to other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard-boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like.

For example, on February 6, 2018, Elon Musk and SpaceX launched the first Tesla into space.  The company did this as part of the first test flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket.  Both SpaceX and rival company Blue Origins have been developing reusable rockets to lift people and payloads to space.  Blue Origins made the first launch of a reusable on November 23, 2015.  Since that time, reusables have proven themselves to be stalwart members of the launch inventory.

E.g. the Russians also built a space shuttle, called the Buran.  The Buran also had a space plane which could land on earth after mission.  However it did not participate in the launch.  The engines on the Buran where only used in orbit.  The Space shuttle allowed some degree of reusability, but that is not unique to space vehicles with space planes.  Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and New Shepard all offer partial reusability.  In fact they are superior systems of reusability.  Far more is reused at lower cost.  While I know the space shuttle have a lot of die hard fans, I will claim it was an utter failure.  The space shuttle system was a more expensive way of launching cargo into space, that almost any expendable rocket (space vehicle).  Thus limited reuse, did not facilitate lower costs.  Not until Falcon 9 arrived did reuse actually produce lower launch costs.

So that is what he had SpaceX focus on first.  Then once that was accomplished he had SpaceX focus on getting a larger rocket into space.  Once that was done he focused SpaceX on making a reusable rocket.  Then he focused SpaceX on making larger reusable rockets.  He keeps going one step at a time while focusing on his end goal.  Elon has been using this process to guide the macro strategy at SpaceX for almost 20 years.  Elon also applies this deep, organized way of thinking on the micro level as well.  A great illustration of the way Elon thinks is when a SpaceX employee would recommend buying a part they need.  Elon would ask a series of questions like this: Is it optimized for your solution?  Is it from a good supplier?  But what about the suppliers suppliers?  Are they reliable?  What if we need more of this part faster, would they be able to produce them fast enough?

Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  Its because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Lets elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  Its a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceXs Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable. Its melting point is -259C or -435F, and its boiling point is -252C or -423F.

Cylinders Internal combustion engines can contain any number of cylinders with numbers between one and twelve being common, though as many as 36 (Lycoming R-7755) have been used.  Having more cylinders in an engine yields two potential benefits: First, the engine can have a larger displacement with smaller individual reciprocating masses (that is, the mass of each piston can be less) thus making a smoother running engine (since the engine tends to vibrate as a result of the pistons moving up and down).  Finally, superheated liquid hydrogen was used in many bubble chamber experiments.  The first thermonuclear bomb, Ivy Mike, used liquid deuterium (hydrogen-2), for nuclear fusion.

Start with fuel (something to burn) and an oxidizer (something to make it burn) and now youve got propellant.  Give it a spark and energy is released, along with some byproducts.  For SLS to fly, combustion takes place in two primary areas: the main engines (four Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25s) and the twin solid rocket boosters (built by Orbital ATK) that provide more than 75 percent of thrust at liftoff.  Combustion powers both propulsion systems, but the fuels and oxidizers are different.  Steam clouds, the product of the SLS main engines hydrogen-oxygen reaction, pour from an RS-25 engine during testing at NASAs Stennis Space Center.  The RS-25 main engines are called liquid engines because the fuel is liquid hydrogen (LH2).  Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer.  The boosters, on the other hand, use aluminum as fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, mixed with a binder that creates one homogenous solid propellant.

This is how its been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, weve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earths resources  including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs dont normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.

The Most Iconic Scene From Every Star Wars Movie By Nick Hilden / Aug. 5, 2020 3:57 pm EDT / Updated: Aug. 5, 2020 4:35 pm EDT There are few, if any, film franchises that have impacted the movie industry as much as Star Wars.  When the first installment hit the screen in 1977, it blasted the culture with the force of a Star Destroyer dropping out of hyperspace, changing the way fans digest movies and the way studios produce them.  Star Wars gave us a slew of the most repeated lines of dialogue in history, opened the doors for future juggernaut franchises like the MCU, and introduced us to Baby Yoda.  What more can one film series do?  Over the course of 11 live-action films, we've watched the drama of the Skywalker Saga, the rise of a young Han Solo, and the early days of the Rebellion.  And with each landmark movie, we've witnessed a whole host of memorable moments, from epic action scenes to emotional farewells.  But which scenes are the ones that truly stick with us?

Namor the Sub-Mariner My first pick has to be Namor the Sub-Mariner.  Though his film distribution rights were at one point owned by Universal and the rights situation around him is still murky, hes one of the most prominent and long-running Avengers in the comics, and also a really great character.  He was slated to first appear in a book called Motion Picture Funnies Weekly, but that issue was never released and thus Namor McKenzie first appeared in the legendary Marvel Comics #1 in 1939.  He predates DCs Aquaman by two years and like the orange-scaled Justice Leaguer, Namor is the son of a human man and an Atlantean princess.  Namor would be a great chance for Marvel to cast a South-Asian actor in a lead role, and would make a truly great addition to the MCU.  He even has an easy in to the current MCU, as the comics have updated his backstory to make his father an explorer searching for Vibranium.

This Fridays Black Panther spotlights the Oscar-winning Lupita Nyongo as Nakia, a Wakandan spy who fights alongside the title character and his fierce all-female special forces unit, the Dora Milaje.  For the Kenyan-raised Nyongo, its a chance to escape the veil of CGI effects in Disneys Jungle Book and Star Wars franchise and play a high-profile partin a film that celebrates Africa.

We saw the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up against.  That was difficult for us because we had a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas that we were trying to get out and nothing new really worked.

They can be biased, just like their designers.  Search patterns matter because sites like Google are becoming increasingly powerful arbiters of public information.  Search results are not objective truths.  Philippe Huguen / AFP - Getty Images Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST / Updated Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST By Noah Berlatsky, cultural critic In 2010, communications scholar Safiya U. Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces.  She searched black girls on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people.  Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com.  The first page was filled with similar results.  According to Google in 2010, black girls were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?  Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for black girls because those are the sites that people click on most.  But based on her own experiments with Google search and on the scholarly literature related to search engines, Noble thinks this rationale is too simplistic.

    "R00131": " Search neutrality  Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.    Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.  Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

Noble argues that search algorithms are racist and perpetuate societal problems because they reflect the negative biases that exist in society and the people who create them.

    "R00134": "Essentially, the process of indexing is identifying the words and expressions that best describe the page and assigning the page to particular keywords. Processing - When a search request comes, the search engine processes it, i.e. it compares the search string in the search request with the indexed pages in the database.  Calculating Relevancy - It is likely that more than one page contains the search string, so the search engine starts calculating the relevancy of each of the pages in its index to the search string.  Retrieving Results - The last step in search engine activities is retrieving the best matched results.  Basically, it is nothing more than simply displaying them in the browser.  Search engines such as Google and Yahoo!  often update their relevancy algorithm dozens of times per month.  When you see changes in your rankings it is due to an algorithmic shift or something else outside of your control.  Although the basic principle of operation of all search engines is the same, the minor differences between their relevancy algorithms lead to major changes in results relevancy.

Written by Emily Cronkleton on November 5, 2018 Overview Weight loss Risks What to eat When to eat Takeaway Share on Pinterest Recommendations Should you work out on an empty stomach?  That depends.  Its often recommended that you work out first thing in the morning before eating breakfast, in whats known as a fasted state.  This is believed to help with weight loss.  However, working out after eating may give you more energy and improve your performance.  Read on to learn the benefits and risks of working out on an empty stomach, plus suggestions for what to eat before and after exercise.  Does working out on an empty stomach help you lose more weight?  Exercising on an empty stomach is whats known as fasted cardio.  The theory is that your body feeds on stored fat and carbohydrates for energy instead of food youve recently eaten, leading to higher levels of fat loss.  Research from 2016 points to the benefits of working out in a fasted state in terms of weight management.  The study among 12 men found that those who didnt eat breakfast before exercising burned more fat and reduced their caloric intake over 24 hours.  Some research dispels this theory.

    "R00157": "Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.

With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the  Saturday Night Massacre ; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski.  In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that a tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972, had an 18 12 minute gap.  Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked.  The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.  Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washingtons Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.

Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it.  J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W.

This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes natural laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are real?

Some say the cake was named after the bird because it was sweet enough to attract hummingbirds (who eat only nectar), while others say the yellow streaks of banana was reminiscent of the birds plumage.  Either way, the Doctor bird was about to take flight.  In 1968, the Jamaican tourist board decided to try attracting tourists by sending out press kits to the US.  In the packs were a few recipes from the island, including one for the Doctor bird cake.  Over the next few years, similar recipes started to crop up in local papers and community cookbooks across the South under various different names, including the prophetic Cake that doesnt last.  Most food historians agree the first printed recipe for Hummingbird cake was by one Mrs L H Wiggin.

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).  The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries.  The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.  A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal.  Thank God we know better.  Key Ingredients In Jollof Rice Jollof rice is made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, salt, spices and vegetable oil.  These are the standard ingredients. Other varying ingredients include assorted vegetables, and different types of local spices. Nigerian Jollof Rice The first key difference in Nigerian Jollof is the type of rice grain used. ",

Unlike Nigerian Jollof, Ghanian Jollof rice doesnt have a party version that is cooked over fire wood.  A Battle of Taste So which Jollof tastes better?  Frankly we cant seem to decide.  Both dishes taste great and it will be unfair to rate a dish above the other.  Why?  Both dishes are unique.  Honestly we dont think they can or should be compared.

In all of these cases, innovation is at the heart of the companys success.  Because innovation is inherently risky, there may be outsized economic returns for startups that are able to harness the risk in a new way  but this is not an essential part of the startup character.  The real question is: what is the degree of innovation that this business proposes to accomplish?  There is one last important part of this definition: the context in which the innovation happens.

There are three key aspects to the cFS architecture: a dynamic run-time environment, layered software, and a component based design.  It is the combination of these key aspects that makes it suitable for reuse on any number of NASA flight projects and/or embedded software systems at a significant cost savings.  The cFS flight software framework takes advantage of a rich heritage of successful Goddard Space Flight Center flight software efforts and addresses the challenges of rapidly increasing software development costs and schedules due to the constant changes and advancements in hardware.  Flight software size and complexity is expected to grow dramatically in coming years and the cFS provides a means to manage the growth and partition complexity.

SpaceX said in January 2014 that if they are successful in developing the reusable technology, launch prices of around US$5 to 7 million for a reusable Falcon 9 were possible, and following the successful first stage recovery in December 2015, Musk said that the potential cost reduction over the long term is probably in excess of a factor of 100.

    "R00227": "Public information released in November 2012 indicated that SpaceX might have a family of Raptor-designated rocket engines in mind; this was confirmed by SpaceX in October 2013. However, in March 2014 SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that the focus of the new engine development program is exclusively on the full-size Raptor engine; smaller subscale methalox engines were not planned on the development path to the very large Raptor engine.  In October 2013, SpaceX announced that they would be performing methane engine tests of Raptor engine components at the John C. Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi, and that SpaceX would add equipment to the existing test stand infrastructure in order to support liquid methane and hot gaseous methane engine component testing.  In April 2014, SpaceX completed the requisite upgrades and maintenance to the Stennis test stand to prepare for testing of Raptor components, and the engine component testing program began in earnest, focusing on the development of robust startup and shutdown procedures, something that is typically quite difficult to do for full-flow staged combustion cycle engines.  Component testing at Stennis also allowed hardware characterization and verification of proprietary analytical software models that SpaceX developed to push the technology on this engine cycle that had little prior development work in the West. Roll control  and attitude control during the coast phase  is provided by helium cold gas thrusters.

    "R00228": "The methanation reactions of COx in the presence of a nickel catalyst were discovered by the French chemist Paul Sabatier in 1902 [ 4618].  For his method of hydrogenating organic compounds, Sabatier was awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1912.  Due to its high octane and low cetane number, methane cannot be used directly in unmodified diesel engines.  There are several natural gas engine approaches that allow the use of methane-based gaseous fuels in internal combustion engines.  These engine technologies can be classified into: (1) stoichiometric Otto cycle engines, (2) lean burn, Otto cycle engines, (3) dual fuel mixed cycle (combination of Otto and Diesel) engines, and (4) diesel cycle, high pressure direct injection (HPDI) natural gas engines.  The stoichiometric Otto cycle engines are typically spark-ignited, while the other types of natural gas engines usually rely on diesel pilot ignition.  Hydrogen Hydrogen has been receiving significant attention as a potential future alternative fuel.  It is envisioned that low-carbon hydrogen could be produced via hydrolysis of water using renewable electricity supplied by wind and solar powerplants.  At present, the commercial production of hydrogen is contingent on natural gas. Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this",
    "R00229": "Lithium and fluorine are both extremely corrosive, lithium ignites on contact with air, fluorine ignites on contact with most fuels, and hydrogen, while not hypergolic, is an explosive hazard. Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which damages the environment, makes work around the launch pad difficult, and makes getting a launch license that much more difficult.  The rocket exhaust is also ionized, which would interfere with radio communication with the rocket.  Nuclear thermal rocket engines differ from conventional rocket engines in that energy is supplied to the propellants by an external nuclear heat source instead of the heat of combustion.  The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing liquid hydrogen gas through an operating nuclear reactor.  Testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulses of about 850 seconds (8,340 m/s), about twice that of the Space Shuttle engines.  A variety of other rocket propulsion methods, such as ion thrusters, give much higher specific impulse but with much lower thrust; for example the Hall effect thruster on the SMART-1 satellite has a specific impulse of 1,640 s (16,100 m/s) but a maximum thrust of only 68 millinewtons.  The variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) engine currently in development will theoretically yield 20,000300,000 m/s, and a maximum thrust of 5.7 newtons. An air-breathing engine typically has a much larger specific impulse than a rocket: a jet engine may have a specific impulse of 20003000 seconds or more at sea level. In some",
    "R00230": "What is a scramjet engine Rocket engines typically carry both fuel and oxidizers for combustion, but engines developed with an air-breathing propellant system use oxygen from the atmosphere. The Scramjet engine uses hydrogen as a fuel (which it carries with it completely) and uses oxygen from the atmosphere as an oxidizer that is necessary to burn hydrogen.  Advantages of Scramjet Engine:  Lightweight will reduce the space expenditure by up to 90 percent due to the lighter weight of the current rocket.   More payload can be sent by a rocket.

Liquid rockets can be monopropellant rockets using a single type of propellant, or bipropellant rockets using two types of propellant.  Tripropellant rockets using three types of propellant are rare.  Some designs are throttleable for variable thrust operation and some may be restarted after a previous in-space shutdown.

This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ISP and better system performance.  A liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling, which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle.

The reusable rocket is the space launch system which allows recovery of its all or partial parts for later reuse.  The system can be categorized into fully reusable and partially reusable.  Following are the specifications of Falcon-9 reusable rocket.   Length: 68 m  Dry mass: 25 tonnes  Take-off mass: 506 tonnes  Payload to LEO: About 13 tonnes  Vehicle Cost: About 40 million  Refuel Cost: 130,000  Reusability: About 10 flights Figure-1 depicts flight of reusable rocket developed by SpaceX to launch Dragon cargo ship and its return on the Earth back.  Benefits or advantages of Reusable Rocket Following are the benefits or advantages of Reusable Rocket: Cost for launching becomes much cheaper as it reduces material cost due to reusability.  Some of the reusable rockets use kerosene (of rocket grade type) as fuel which do not generate harmful chlorine as exhaust.  This helps to protect the environment.  We can effectively reuse rockets similar to airplanes, hence space travel will become cheaper to a greater extent.

    "R00234": "What Happens When Coral Reefs Die  Blane Perun's TheSea Credit: Blane Perun What Happens When Coral Reefs Die December 7, 2017 March 10, 2021 Blane Perun In most cases, the answer to the question of what happens when coral reefs die is that they are simply replaced by other coral polyp larvae, which go on to mature and form new reef formations.  This is how its been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, weve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earths resources  including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs dont normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged. They can be parasites for other animals, though. They can go inside swimming crabs.  The crabs don't die, but they get hurt.  Competition Competition is when animals",
    "R00235": "In addition to their role as autotrophs, Cyanobacteria also help build the reef structure, fix nitrogen, serve as a food source for other reef species, and are (some species) agents of coral disease. The full magnitude and nature and of the importance of Cyanobacteria to coral reef ecology is only beginning to be unraveled, but it is clear that these tiny creatures are a major piece of the puzzle that we face in understanding and addressing human impacts on coral reefs.  Primary Consumers: The Herbivores A wide variety of herbivorous animals reside on coral reefs, including invertebrates (such as mollusks and echinoderms) as well as fishes.  The most important of the herbivorous coral reef fishes are the parrotfishes , surgeonfishes , rabbitfishes , rudderfishes and damselfishes.  Almost all populations of some of the largest and most important of the other vertebrate plant feeders  sea turtles, manatees, and dugongs  have been severely decimated by human impacts over the past three centuries.  These losses have likely altered the pre-disturbance coral reef food webs in substantial ways, but deciphering exactly what those impacts have been is highly speculative.  More information on the feeding habits of these creatures is provided on our webpage dedicated to coral reef animals.  Secondary Consumers: The Carnivores Animals that feed as carnivores in the coral reef biome are extremely numerous and abundant. Fishers that practice blast fishing in the Philippines today could receive prison sentences of as many as 10 years",
    "R00236": "Impact on Oceans and Sea Life Storing carbon in the ocean has drawbacks of its own. As carbon dioxide reacts with the water it forms carbonic acid.  This could worsen ocean acidification, which kills sea life such as coral and edible species of fish that form a major part of the world food supply.  Even when the carbon dioxide is pumped to great depths, it may not be long before it is released back into the atmosphere.  Strong winds caused by climate change are mixing waters in the oceans, causing carbon dioxide to rise to the surface from the ocean's depths.  Potential for Underground Leaks Critics of carbon storage are also concerned about the possibility of carbon dioxide leaks from underground storage spaces.  Naturally occurring leaks can be extremely destructive, killing humans and animals, and if carbon storage became a common solution, such leaks could increase in frequency and severity.  Even when fitted with no-return valves, carbon injection pipes could break down over time, allowing the gases to resurface.  Uses For Captured Carbon One solution to the problems associated with carbon storage is to find uses for the captured carbon.  Carbon capture and utilization could be more economically viable than storage, turning the captured carbon dioxide into valuable new products like bio-oils, fertilizers, chemicals and fuels.  Know more about carbon storage? Efforts are being made in the Philippines to increase awareness of the potential impacts of ocean acidification. However, it will",
    "R00237": "It lives in harmony with a certain kind of colorful algae. The algae make food using sunlight, a process called photosynthesis.  They share the food with the coral, and, in turn, the coral gives the algae a safe and sunny place to live.  The two of them get along fine, living in clean, clear, shallow waters where the Sun shines through brightly.  Fish love coral too, because there are lots of nooks and crannies for them to hide in.  But the algae cannot carry out photosynthesis in water that is too warm.  The algae either die, or the coral spits it out.  Scientists are not sure exactly what happens, but it's bad for the algae, the coral, and the fish.  The corals lose their colorful food sources and become weak.  This sad event is called coral bleaching, and it is happening on a grand scale in many places around the world.  How does the ocean soak up CO 2? Fish and other animals in the ocean breathe oxygen and give off carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), just like land animals.  Ocean plants take in the carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, just like land plants.  The ocean is great at sucking up CO2 from the air. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the 70 million GtC of carbonate rock and kerogen. Long Term Cycling of Carbon As described above, an individual carbon atom could cycle",
    "R00238": "Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil puts more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. NASA has observed increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and some other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.  Too much of these greenhouse gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat.  This causes Earth to warm up.  What reduces the greenhouse effect on Earth?  Just like a glass greenhouse, Earth's greenhouse is also full of plants!  Plants can help to balance the greenhouse effect on Earth.  All plants  from giant trees to tiny phytoplankton in the ocean  take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.  The ocean also absorbs a lot of excess carbon dioxide in the air.  Unfortunately, the increased carbon dioxide in the ocean changes the water, making it more acidic.  This is called ocean acidification.  More acidic water can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as certain shellfish and coral.  Warming oceans  from too many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  can also be harmful to these organisms.  Warmer waters are a main cause of coral bleaching.  This photograph shows a bleached brain coral.  A main cause of coral bleaching is warming oceans.  Ocean acidification also stresses coral reef communities.

Among the many well-intentioned beliefs for how to best approach diversity in society, two stand out: color-blindness and multiculturalism.  So lets take a look at what these two approaches to diversity mean and look at the evidence regarding how effective they are.  Color-blindness vs. Multiculturalism Right off the bat, its worth mentioning that both of these approaches to diversity share the goal of achieving positive intergroup relations and social equality.  But well see soon how they dont always live up to those goals.  To start color-blindness is all about ignoring group differences.  That is, someone who holds a color-blind approach believes that characteristics like race should not even be taken into account when it comes to making choices and judgments.  Instead, color-blindness is about focusing on what unites usfocusing on our similarities instead of our differences. In this case, 43% of students who heard about a multicultural approach to diversity saw discrimination in the story, but only 10% of kids in the color-blindness condition saw discrimination. To me, though, the most compelling finding was that when it came to a clear-cut case of discrimination, 77% of kids who heard a multicultural approach to diversity saw discrimination in the story. ",

Short segments using finished game engines may be presented as game demos.

    "R00255": "This is the problem that the Raffs had, and when they tried to contact the search engine giants for feedback, or an appeal process, they werent given much to work with. Online shopping services rely on traffic (which comes mostly form search engines) to be successful.  However, if a major search engine demotes its site to the second or third page of results, its traffic (and profit) numbers will suffer in a major way.  So why is this a problem?  The biggest issue is that online shopping networks have to pay for their ads on search engines.  The search engines though can put their results right next to the ads of their competitors, even though they dont have to pay for the spots.  By manipulating the algorithms that decide which shopping links to show, the search engine can lead people to click on its own ads even though they dont have to pay for the ads.  Consider then that a big search engine has a particular political ideology they want to promote.  All they have to do is change the search algorithms to influence public opinion to support their own interests.  Because we dont use your data to determine which search results you see, we cant serve targeted ads.  So our ads will be based on your search terms and nothing else!

    "R00257": " Search neutrality  Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.    Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.  Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

These changes will likely include major shifts in wind patterns, annual precipitation and seasonal temperatures variations.  In addition, because high levels of greenhouse gases are likely to remain in the atmosphere for many years, these changes are expected to last for several decades or longer, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  In the northeastern United States, for example, climate change is likely to bring increased annual rainfall, while in the Pacific Northwest, summer rainfall is expected to decrease, the EPA said.  Ice melt One of the primary manifestations of climate change so far is melt.  North America, Europe and Asia have all seen a trend toward less snow cover between 1960 and 2015, according to 2016 research published in the journal Current Climate Change Reports.  According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, there is now 10 percent less permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, in the Northern Hemisphere than there was in the early 1900s.

You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.

If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.

    "R00275": "“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.

The Watergate break-in, like the Ellsberg operation before it, was a practice drill.  Mitchell and Haldeman and Colson (and Nixon) wanted to know that someone on their team had the cojones and the technical skills to pull off an illegal domestic spying operation.  That was the real motive -- and the only motive -- for Watergate.  If there had been any desired information, Haldeman (the top guy on the Nixon staff pyramid) would have known about it, and would have been happy to have sold more books by revealing it in one of the several books he'd eventually write.  The greatest evidence that there was no important information to be gained by spying on the Democrats was that Democratic candidate George McGovern was barely threatening Nixon at all in the upcoming November 1972 elections.  The polls showed a nearly historic advantage for Nixon at the time of the break-in, because Nixon was still very popular with voters at this time.  The awkward truth is this: if an accidental Bell Telephone party line had suddenly given Bob Haldeman access to the Democratic National Committee's private telephone calls, Haldeman probably wouldn't have cared enough to have listened for long.

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell.  At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty.  G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison.  Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC).  Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.

The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.  At first, he gave Congress 19 tapes — but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.  In a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him.  “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said on April 29, 1974.  He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove “irrelevant” information that was not subject to Congress’s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns and promising that the rest would be sufficient.  But to House leaders, it wasn’t.  Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said that “we will accept nothing less” than the tapes — and months later, they got them.

President Nixon released the tape on August 5.  It was one of three conversations he had with Haldeman six days after the Watergate break-in.  The tapes prove that he ordered a cover-up of the Watergate burglary.  The Smoking Gun tape reveals that Nixon ordered the FBI to abandon its investigation of the break-in.  After the release of the tape, the eleven Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who voted against impeachment charges said they would change their votes.

Some are good, some are bad – and all of them largely overlooked during the ordeal of the past few months.  The impact is deep and will be enduring.  It will be a long time, if ever, before politics in the United States is the same again.  A massive drive is on in statehouse to overhaul the way elections are run.  Congress is moving to enact new laws.  And even without prodding, many politicians are racing to open up their financial affairs.  More 40th Anniversary Coverage: QUIZ:  Do You Know Nixon?

    "R00281": "However, Nixon left a legacy as complex as his personality. Nixon did not owe his success in politics to personality or charm: in fact, even many of his staunch supporters described him as cold, aloof, crude, arrogant and paranoid.  President Dwight D. Eisenhower himself, whom Nixon served as vice president, claimed that Nixon would never win the presidency because the people don’t like him.  After proving his former boss wrong, Nixon left the office in disgrace, resigning in the face of impending impeachment.  His paranoia of political sabotage by his opponents had inspired him to authorize the wire-tapping of enemies and supporters alike.  Ironically, it was the conversations he taped in his own office that led to his ultimate downfall.  Despite the immense disappointment and distrust in government that the Watergate scandal inspired in most Americans, Nixon was correct in assuming that some aspects of his leadership would be judged favorably with the passage of time.  These include his bold efforts to improve diplomatic relations with China and Russia, as well as pushing lasting and influential legislation through Congress.  Nixon’s legislative legacy includes the National Environmental Policy Act, passed in 1969, which created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation.  Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it.  J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years (1976), based on three New York Times Sunday Magazine articles, but he was widely criticized.  According to an article in Slate on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 Playboy interview with Lukas.  On May 31, 2005, Vanity Fair revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf.

Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.

Early Calabar History Most historical records indicate towards Calabar gaining prominence during the early part of the 17th century.  This was largely due to the increasing trading relations between the African tribes like the Efik and Ibibio people.  Calabar turned into a major port with fish, bananas and cassava being traded among the surrounding communities.  However, the  increasing trade eventually caught the attention of the colonial powers  which were aggressively increasing their presence in Africa during this  time.  Tracing Colonial Rule in Calabar History Calabar’s earliest colonial rulers were the Portuguese who coined the  name \"Old Calabar.\"  The name existed until 1904.  The Portuguese were attracted by the rich supply of food resources.  During this time, Calabar also emerged as one of busiest slave-trading depots in Africa. 19th and 20th Century Events in Calabar History The middle of 19th century witnessed Calabar losing its position in the African slave trade.  During this phase, it progressed into being a major trading port for palm-based products such as palm oil and kernels.   Somewhere around 1883, the Portuguese control over Nigerian colonies weakened due to the increased militarization by the British forces. ",

    "R00297": " The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance Tango is one of the most famous and influential dances in the world.  Originating in Buenos Aires in the 18th century, tango brought together working class European immigrants, indigenous Argentinians and former slaves.  As a result, tango has shaped Argentinian culture and society.  The dance’s popularity meant that it quickly expanded out of Argentina, with several different styles developing in Europe and North America.  With its rich history, tango is a fascinating tradition in dance which reveals a wealth of information about Argentina traditions.  Argentina traditions: The origin of tango The word “tango” or “tambo” appears around the turn of the 19th century to describe music and dance events organized by slaves.  The first official use of the word appears in a statute from 1789, where Argentine authorities banned “tango” gatherings to oppress the working class.  It wasn’t until one hundred years later that the word became commonplace.  The original tango dance was a blend of styles produced by the mix of cultures in the lively port of Buenos Aires.  In the 19th century, thousands of young people arrived from Europe in search of a better life. ",

It is typical for Argentines and Uruguayans to have \"once\" or \"merienda\" around 5pm, between the midday meal and supper.  It generally consists of an infusion (tea, mate, coffee, mate cocido, etc.) and a baked snack (scones, bread, toasts, cake, facturas, etc.), usually accompanied with dulce de leche, honey, butter or jam.

    "R00300": "Due to the geography of the Pampas and a small national market, the cattle multiplied rapidly. Railway building within Argentina and the invention of refrigerated trains and ships in the late 19th century made an export market and Argentina's beef export industry started to thrive.  The flipped seasons between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meant that Argentine beef came onto the market at a time of year when beef was less at hand in the Northern Hemisphere, which further lifted the potential export market in the United States and European markets.  Following the rising demand for high-quality beef, new breeds and selective crossbreeding have been developed.  Argentine beef and its production have played a major part in the culture of Argentina, from the asado to the history of the gauchos of the Pampas.  Landowners became wealthy from beef production and export, and estancia owners built large houses, important buildings in Buenos Aires and elsewhere, and contributed to politics, philanthropy, and society.  The agricultural show La Rural each winter in Buenos Aires became a major part of the social season since it started in 1886.  In Chile, heightened taxes for the import of Argentine cattle in 1905 led to the meat riots, one of the first massive protests in Santiago. ",

However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.

    "R00305": " When coral gets too hot, the animal does something strange — it bleaches.  The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly.  For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior.  It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart.  Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe.  A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea.  As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae.  “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.  Lewis and his colleague Luke Nothdurft published their observations recently in the journal Coral Reefs.  Coral provide shelter for the tiny photosynthesizing organisms, which in turn produce excess sugar that the animals can eat.  Without that food supply, coral may starve. ",
    "R00306": "As we’ve mentioned, calcium carbonate is one of the ways that CO2 is taken out of the ocean, and that is because it becomes apart of shells, corals and other marine life. When any of these die, they end up on the ocean floor.  So over millions and millions of years, the dead marine life moves with the tectonic plates.  Under heat and pressure, this calcium carbonate ends up becoming rocks (such as limestone), so we end up with a lot of CO2 eventually ending up in stone.  So to sum: CO2 ends up in the oceans (which is already where most of it is contained), some gets formed into shells and corals which end up as stone or fuel (organic matter over millions of years), and by using this organic matter we’re pumping it back into the atmosphere.  As such, it seems quite reasonable that we should just be able to pump it back into the oceans to help keep this cycle continuing for millions of years more.  However, we’ve found that an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean increases the pH levels.  For anyone that has ever had a tropical fish in a tank, they well understand how important it is to keep the correct pH levels.  Advertisement Advertisement So what is all the fuss about? ",

Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.  Risks Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking, free ride and dirt jumping. ",
    "R00309": "A bikepacking bag kit typically consists of a frame pack, a handlebar bag or harness, a seat pack and several smaller peripheral bags that live on the frame, handlebars and forks, helping to spread weight across the bike. Here are definitions and pointers for each: Frame Packs The frame pack was conceived to allow storage within a bike’s triangle – the space formed by the top tube, seat tube and downtube.  It’s usually lashed on by a series of velcro straps.  Frame packs are available for both full suspension, hardtail and rigid bikes alike.  While ideally each is custom made to fit a snugly within a bike’s unique frame, there are some universally sized bags commercially available that will fit most bikes.  The frame bag is an excellent place to store heavier items as it maintains a low center of gravity, though smaller frames and full suspension will have more limited capacities.  If you want to keep the option of mounting two water bottle cages, there are half/partial -framebags available too.  See below for details.  What to consider Watch those zips Zips are the weakest part of a frame pack, as with all gear.  Try and resist the temptation to cram as much as you can in, as it will inevitably stress the zip in the long run and cause it to split. ",
    "R00310": "This is particularly common on bikes with carbon fiber frames, full-suspension mountain bikes, and folding bikes. Any bike can be fitted with bikepacking bags because they attach with Velcro and straps.  Nothing bolts to the frame.  This allows you to tour on any bike.  You won’t overpack when you use bikepacking bags Most bicycle tourists overpack.  Bikepacking bags solve that problem because they simply offer less volume than panniers.  A typical bikepacking setup usually offers 45 liters of volume between the three main bags while a standard set of 4 panniers can hold 65 liters.  Because you have less volume to work with, you have to consider every piece of gear that you pack.  There is no space for luxury items or things you’ll rarely use.  You can only pack the necessities.  This prevents overpacking and makes your whole setup much lighter.  In fact, some riders consider this to be the only reason that bikepacking bags are lighter than panniers.  If your bikepacking bags tear, you can repair them yourself Because bikepacking bags are made of fabric, you can easily repair holes with a needle and thread.  A small sewing kit is lightweight and takes up very little space.  You can even use the same sewing kit that you use for tubeless tire repair. ",

Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google’s search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.  But here’s the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google’s algorithm is biased.  Let’s dive into the case study.  Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.

    "R00316": "By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines). There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.

    "R00317": " Search neutrality  Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.    Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.  Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.

Google ranking systems are designed to do just that: sort through hundreds of billions of webpages in our Search index to find the most relevant, useful results in a fraction of a second, and present them in a way that helps you find what you’re looking for.  These ranking systems are made up of not one, but a whole series of algorithms.  To give you the most useful information, Search algorithms look at many factors, including the words of your query, relevance and usability of pages, expertise of sources, and your location and settings.  The weight applied to each factor varies depending on the nature of your query—for example, the freshness of the content plays a bigger role in answering queries about current news topics than it does about dictionary definitions.  To help ensure Search algorithms meet high standards of relevance and quality, we have a rigorous process that involves both live tests and thousands of trained external Search Quality Raters from around the world.  These Quality Raters follow strict guidelines that define our goals for Search algorithms and are publicly available for anyone to see. ",

Credit: Left - Mellimage/Shutterstock.com, center - Montree Hanlue/Shutterstock.com.  › en español Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment.  Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.  Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.  Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.  Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.

    "R00528": "Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called \"highly climate vulnerable\") due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy. ",
    "R00529": " President Trump announced Thursday afternoon that he is withdrawing the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, an extraordinary move that dismayed America’s allies and set back the global effort to address the warming planet.  Trump’s decision set off alarms worldwide, drawing swift and sharp condemnation from foreign leaders as well as top environmentalists and corporate titans, who decried the U.S. exit from the Paris accord as an irresponsible abdication of American leadership in the face of irrefutable scientific evidence.  Trump, who has labeled climate change a “hoax,” made good on a campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement and Obama-era regulations that he said were decimating industries and killing jobs.  The president cast his decision as a “reassertion of America’s sovereignty,” arguing that the climate pact as negotiated under President Barack Obama was grossly unfair to the U.S. workers he had vowed to protect with his populist “America First” platform.  “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump proclaimed in a forceful, lengthy and at times rambling speech from the Rose Garden of the White House.  He added, “As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.” ",

It’s not as intense a calorie burner as cross-country skiing, but you still end up burning many calories — a 150-pound person will torch about 240 calories for every 30 minutes of skiing downhill.

As with skiing, how fast and how long you skate will determine how many calories you ultimately burn.  A 150-pound person can burn about 240 calories in 30 minutes of rounding the rink at a respectable speed.

Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.  If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.  Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation.  For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: \"You are living in a simulation.

Here are some of the best Nigerian dishes to choose from.  Rice And Stew RICE AND STEW WITH MEATBALLS AND FRIED PLANTAIN Nigerians love rice.  The stew here could range from basic tomato stew to any sauce.  The most popular kind Nigerians use in accompanying the rice is the tomato and pepper stew which has a mix of other spices such as ginger, curry, garlic and more.  Usually cooked with chicken, fish or beef for a unique taste.  Swallow EBA, FUFU, AMALA, STARCH (TL- BL) ‘Swallow’ is a term used in Nigeria to describe the starchy foods that accompany soups.

A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.  A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.

July 24, 2017 in Argentinian Cuisine Argentinian beef has earned a reputation for being some of the world's best.  It's widely known for being incomparably tender and richly flavored, even though it's rarely seasoned with anything but salt.  So what makes Argentine beef taste so good?  The answer lies in the lifespan of the beef, from start to finish.  Grass-Fed on Las Pampas When the Spanish first brought cattle to Argentina in the 16th century, Las Pampas must have looked like paradise to them.  The 289,577 square mile prairie is seemingly endless and mostly flat, with a humid and temperate climate perfect for growing plenty of cow-friendly grass.  The many breeds of cattle introduced to Argentina thrived in the pampas, grazing happily and often, resulting in leaner, more flavorful and nutritious beef.  Whereas most American beef is grain fed, the bulk of Argentinian cattle feed on the plentiful grass, resulting in more omega-3 fatty acids.  That means Argentinian beef produces less risk of cholesterol or heart disease. ",

Most of Argentina’s hogs are raised in the Pampas, principally for domestic consumption.  The cool, moist area of the southeastern Pampas, between Buenos Aires and the city of Mar del Plata, is an important dairy and sheep-raising district.  Corrientes and Entre Ríos remain important cattle-raising provinces, ranking just behind those of the Pampas.  Chaco province began as grazing ground for criollo cattle, but modern breeds have been susceptible to disease there, so the Chaco cattle economy has remained underdeveloped.  Patagonia has at least half of the country’s sheep, most of which are sheared for their wool.  For a period during the 1990s, Argentine beef was banned from importation into the European Union, the United States, and other nations because of the incidence of foot-and-mouth disease.  Exports subsequently resumed but were subject to periodic bans.  Most of the beef produced in Argentina is now eaten locally.  The forestry industry does not supply all of Argentina’s needs.

Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.

    "R00572": " Staged combustion cycle  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity.   Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called \"preburner\" and the second called \"main combustion chamber\".  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the over-pressure produced is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust.   The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust.  The staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as closed cycle, as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber.  The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

To do that, a graduate student and two professors, Virgilio Almeida and Wagner Meira Jr., scraped the top 50 images for “beautiful woman” and “ugly woman” across dozens of international versions of Google and Bing.  They then passed those 2,000-plus images through a program called Face++, which estimates subject age, race and gender with 90 percent accuracy.  Sadly, the race and age breakdown of the “beautiful” pictures versus the “ugly” ones are probably what you’d expect. ",

Part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors, e.g., changes in precipitation and flooding events.  It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend.  The trend does, however, suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change.  A 2019 modelling study found that climate change had contributed towards global economic inequality.  Wealthy countries in colder regions had either felt little overall economic impact from climate change, or possibly benefited, whereas poor hotter countries very likely grew less than if global warming had not occurred.  The total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate, but increase for higher temperature changes.  For instance, total damages are estimated to be 90% less if global warming is limited to 1.5 C compared to 3.66 C, a warming level chosen to represent no mitigation.  One study found a 3.5% reduction in global GDP by the end of the century if warming is limited to 3 C, excluding the potential effect of tipping points.  Another study noted that global economic impact is underestimated by a factor of two to eight when tipping points are excluded from consideration.",

Livelihoods Economic damages due to climate change have been underestimated, and may be severe, with the probability of disastrous tail-risk events being nontrivial.  Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and is projected to continue doing so.  Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where existing poverty is already exacerbated.  The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.  Current inequalities between men and women, between rich and poor, and between different ethnicities have been observed to worsen as a consequence of climate variability and climate change.  An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities, but that future warming will bring increasing risks.  Low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened through hazards posed by sea level rise, such as flooding and permanent submergence.

Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the worlds poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.

Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.

Those activities included such dirty tricks as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious.

Eisenhower himself, whom Nixon served as vice president, claimed that Nixon would never win the presidency because the people dont like him.  After proving his former boss wrong, Nixon left the office in disgrace, resigning in the face of impending impeachment.  His paranoia of political sabotage by his opponents had inspired him to authorize the wire-tapping of enemies and supporters alike.  Ironically, it was the conversations he taped in his own office that led to his ultimate downfall.  Despite the immense disappointment and distrust in government that the Watergate scandal inspired in most Americans, Nixon was correct in assuming that some aspects of his leadership would be judged favorably with the passage of time.  These include his bold efforts to improve diplomatic relations with China and Russia, as well as pushing lasting and influential legislation through Congress.

However, if an oil spill occurs while corals are spawning, the eggs and sperm can be damaged as they float near the surface before they fertilize and settle. So, in addition to compromising water quality, oil pollution can disrupt the reproductive success of corals, making them vulnerable to other types of disturbances.  In many areas, coral reefs are destroyed when coral heads and brightly-colored reef fishes are collected for the aquarium and jewelry trade.  Careless or untrained divers can trample fragile corals, and many fishing techniques can be destructive.  In blast fishing, dynamite or other heavy explosives are detonated to startle fish out of hiding places.  This practice indiscriminately kills other species and can crack and stress corals so much that they expel their zooxanthellae.  As a result, large sections of reefs can be destroyed.  Cyanide fishing, which involves spraying or dumping cyanide onto reefs to stun and capture live fish, also kills coral polyps and degrades the reef habitat.  More than 40 countries are affected by blast fishing, and more than 15 countries have reported cyanide fishing activities.

Generally, a more upright position will be more comfortable than a position where your back is close to being horizontal since the upright position will put less stress on your shoulders, arms, hands, etc.  However, the more upright you are, the more wind resistance you have, so you go slower for the same effort.  A very important decision you need to make is how much you're willing to trade off speed for comfort.  In general, dropped handlebars give you a lower, more stretched out position that straight handlebars, or bars with upward curves in the bars, although this is not always the case.  Shock absorption is affected by quite a few factors, including frame and fork design and materials, width and pressure of tires, and suspension (like suspension forks & seatposts).

In medicine, there is a long history of black patients facing barriers to accessing care and receiving less effective health care. Studies have found black patients are less likely to receive pain treatment, potentially lifesaving lung cancer surgery or cholesterol-lowering drugs, compared with white patients.  Such disparities probably have complicated roots, including explicit racism, access problems, lack of insurance, mistrust of the medical system, cultural misunderstandings or unconscious biases that doctors may not even know they have.  Mullainathan and his collaborators discovered that the algorithm they studied, which was designed to help health systems target patients who would have the greatest future health-care needs, was predicting how likely people were to use a lot of health care and rack up high costs in the future.  Since black patients generally use health care at lower rates, the algorithm was less likely to flag them as likely to use lots of health care in the future.  The algorithm would then deepen that disparity by flagging healthier white patients as in need of more intensive care management.  Predictive algorithms that power these tools should be continually reviewed and refined, and supplemented by information such as socio-economic data, to help clinicians make the best-informed care decisions for each patient, Optum spokesman Tyler Mason said.",

Over the years search engine ranking algorithms have evolved and became really complex.  At the beginning (think 2001) it was as simple as matching the users query with the title of the page but this is no longer the case.  Googles ranking algorithm takes into account more than 255 rules before making a decision and nobody knows for sure what these rules are.

Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.

How to use this list: These functional exercises are demonstrated by Jess Movold, NASM-certified trainer and Runner’s World+ Run Coach.  Prior to a run, spend about 30 to 60 seconds performing each dynamic stretch (quad stretches, hip openers and hamstring scoops).  On strength training days, perform each exercise with body weight only for 30 seconds, or load the exercises such as the squats and lunges with enough resistance that you can only perform 10 reps before needing a rest break.  Perform 2 to 3 sets of 10 at this resistance level to improve strength and prevent running related injuries.  [ Runner’s World 10-Minute Cross-Training, gives you five muscle-building routines that take just 10 minutes to get you stronger.]  Dynamic Stretches: Dynamic stretches are functional exercises because they are typically performed in positions and movement patterns similar to those needed to perform a daily task specific to runners.

Get your power on Holly Andres Adding plyometrics into your regular routine will boost strength and speed by improving the elasticity of the muscle via the stretch-shortening cycle.  That is, when the muscle is stretched before an explosive contraction, like bending through the knee before a single leg jump, it contracts more powerfully and quickly.  Because these exercises are explosive in nature, it is best to weave them into your program after you have established a solid base of strength-training, once per week, and in rotation with your strength-training program.  Perform these exercises after your runs to focus on good form, as performing plyometrics with sloppy form can quickly lead to injury.  Here are three plyometric exercises for runners.  By the way, plyometrics are a little like child’s play once you get the hang of it. ",

The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders.  Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security.

Teens that want these so called causes can be pushed to become unsure of who they are and who they want to become.  Social media can affect a teen’s self-esteem by changing their entire style such as clothes, music, and personality and even change what kind of friends they have.  These conflicts that teens deal with throughout the social media world can create a massive amount of depression as teens struggle to be socially “accepted.”  These effects of depression lead to teens having severe insecurities, which then concludes that social networking degrades teens.

Are problems at home causing them stress?  Enforce “social media” breaks.  For example, you could ban social media until your child has completed their homework in the evening, not allow phones at the dinner table or in their bedroom, and plan family activities that preclude the use of phones or other devices.  To prevent sleep problems, always insist phones are turned off at least one hour before bed.  Teach your child how social media is not an accurate reflection of people’s lives.  They shouldn’t compare themselves or their lives negatively to others on social media.  People only post what they want others to see.  Images are manipulated or carefully posed and selected.  And having fewer friends on social media doesn’t make your child less popular or less worthy.  Encourage exercise and offline interests.

The popularity of this dance grew at a  steady pace, especially in the lower-class districts of the cities such as  Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Uruguay).  It is important to mention that  several types of tango dance existed then, with only one of them managing  to find wide popularity outside of the lower class (in a dance that is  today referred as tango criollo or authentic tango).  The origin of the word “ tango ” comes from the words tango/tambo which was used in the region around the  basin of River Plata to describe the musical gatherings of slaves.  With  this term started being used for more types of musical gatherings, it  eventually becomes a synonym of the popular tango dance. ",

Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).

This year’s negotiations were about finalizing the “Paris rule book” — and they somewhat miraculously did, with an accord on the rules finally reached Saturday.  The Paris agreement ushered in a different approach to reducing greenhouse gases, after previous false starts.  Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve.  Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.  In Katowice, negotiators sought to finalize the rules governing those requirements.  The theory was that the international system has weak compliance mechanisms — so the best hope is for countries to figure out what they can do, get started and raise their ambition over time.",

It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.

You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.

Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin.  2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil.  At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance.  If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again.  However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil.

Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.

    "R00768": "“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.",

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell.  At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty.  G.

Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.

President Nixon released the tape on August 5.  It was one of three conversations he had with Haldeman six days after the Watergate break-in.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.

That year the chiefs requested British protection for Calabar, but the reply from Lord Palmerston, received in 1848, was that it was not necessary or advisable to grant the request.  The British said they would treat the people of Calabar favorably if they would give up their practice of human sacrifice.  At the time, it was common for wives and slaves of an important man to be sacrificed upon his death.   On the death of King Eyamba in 1847, it was proposed that King Eyo become sole ruler, which the British favored.  However, the Duke Town leaders did not agree, and selected Archibong Duke as the new king.  In 1850, both kings agreed to suppress human sacrifice.

Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s.  A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time.  The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return.  This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return.  Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme.  How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example.  Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month.  The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month.  The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest.  This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.",

Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.",

The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

    "R00804": "Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.",
    "R00805": "Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?",

Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: \"  [  T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.  Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries.  \"While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.”",
    "R00817": "Search neutrality  Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.    Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.  Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found.  These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color.  For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests.  One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence.  Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms.  But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology.  Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people.  Take cannabis arrests, for just one example.  Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.",

    "R00832": "The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets. Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until inevitable collapse.  A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising.  Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory.  As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value.  A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.  Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant.

Ritmo!  → What kind of clothing women should wear for dancing Tango Posted on February 11, 2012 by Wolfgang Sandt What kind of clothing women should wear for dancing Tango A nice option for Tango clothing: Dress at knee-lenght combined with leggings.  Ready for the Tango lesson I am often asked what kind of clothing I recommend for dancing Tango.  Actually I´m not a friend of dress codes and if you come to La Rogaia for a Tango holiday you´ll find out that I never say a word about somebodies outfit unless I am asked for my opinion.  So what would I tell you?  Ladies dancing Tango use to be dressed very nicely and I certainly know less about Tango fashion than most of them.  So I will limit myself to give some more technical counsels about the right clothing for dancing Tango.  Many tango ladies today wear long wide trousers with slits and/or trousers with ribbons swinging around the ankles.  This looks nice but time and again creates problems while dancing Tango because they get easily caught in their own heels.  Especially when the heels are high.  Actually I see it happen almost every time I go out dancing Tango. ",

    "R00835": "Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking. ",

However, the second stage’s vacuum engine reroutes the gas through the nozzle to provide a layer of cooler gas to keep the extended nozzle from melting.  Raptor However, with Starship development, SpaceX has cranked everything up to 11.  In search of the best rocket engine ever made, they developed a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine known as Raptor.  The reason it is so complicated is that all of the exhaust gas that would normally be dumped overboard after spinning the turbine is instead routed into the main combustion chamber and used for thrust.  Not only that, but there are two of those little rocket engines – each with their own turbines and pumps.  The exhausts from which are pumped into the main combustion chamber.  One of those is fuel-rich and the other is oxygen-rich.  Despite extremely hot gaseous oxygen wanting to turn every bit of the engine into soup, having the fuel and the oxygen arrive in the combustion chamber as a hot gas adds a huge boost in efficiency.  One little note here, if an engine is a closed cycle, we will call the gas generator a preburner since it’s just preburning the fuel or oxidizer, which is then routed straight into the combustion chamber.

The COP26 event is a global united Nations summit about climate change and how countries are planning to tackle it.  It was due to take place in Glasgow from 9 - 19 November with more than 200 world leaders due to attend, but when coronavirus arrived, that all changed.  Cop26 was moved to 1 and 12 November 2021 but many young activists from around the world are meeting at an online conference called Mock COP26 on the original dates.  So what is COP26 all about?

Global warming is the product of the greenhouse effect in action with increasing carbon dioxide and other \"greenhouse gases\".  Carbon dioxide acting like glass in a greenhouse causes the greenhouse effect by permitting visible light to penetrate but impeding the escape of heat.  The increase of fossil fuel burning is the largest source of the increase of global warming.  The long-term results of global warming could be the rising of the oceans, spread of diseases, melting polar caps, extinction of wildlife, and the starvation of millions of humans.

    "R01043": "During the annual Conference of the Parties (COP), nations share information on emissions, policies, and practices, and attempt to develop strategies for addressing climate change. The IPCC consults experts to assess climate change science and presents policy-relevant information outlining how nations can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impact and risks of this global threat.  In 1997, the members of the UNFCCC negotiated the Kyoto Protocol, a legally binding agreement that compelled developed nations to reduce greenhouse emissions over the course of two commitment periods (2008-2012 and 2013-2020).  At the 2015 Conference of the Parties, countries adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change.  The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016, less than a year after it was adopted.  As of August 2020, 189 parties (188 countries plus the European Union) have ratified the Paris Agreement.  The parties agree to limit global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” (3.6 Fahrenheit) this century.  Participating countries are expected to submit their own country-specific emission reduction targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions.  In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are meant to serve as a blueprint for action on critical development issues, such as ending poverty and hunger.",
    "R01044": "Witch hazel is an easy-to-source, natural ingredient that’s also used as an astringent in skincare routines. For this recipe, I recommend using an alcohol-free witch hazel so it doesn’t dry out your skin.  To make this makeup remover, combine 3 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel and 2 tablespoons of nourishing oil (like olive oil).  Before each use, shake the bottle.  To use this makeup remover, apply a small amount of oil to a cotton ball or facial pad, and then gently wipe the face with the moistened pad.  Once your makeup has been removed, wash your face with a cleanser.  I’m currently using this cleanser .  If you’d like a soapy cleanser, I’ve also used this honey face wash recipe.  Pros Lasts a few months.  Great for someone who doesn’t want to use 100% oil on their face.  Another perk of this recipe is that you can use the basic concept to make reusable face wipes, which are very handy if you travel!  Cons Since this recipe is very liquid-y, it’s easy to use a bit too much and get some in your eye (s).  Not that I know anything about this from experience ;).",
    "R01045": "For an oily, irritated scalp, you can add mint or eucalyptus oil. Lotion Using homemade lotion is great when you are trying to avoid harmful chemicals.  Your mom’s skin will need a lotion that moisturizes and tightens the skin.  An easy lotion recipe is using 100 percent natural aloe gel and whipping in an oil of your liking.  You can use pure, edible coconut oil.  Another effective option is using edible cocoa butter.  Add pomegranate seed oil to enhance the lotion’s anti-aging property.  If your mom has oily skin or sensitive skin, you can add tea tree oil or rosemary oil.  Check out this customizable homemade face mask recipe.  Toner A good, homemade toner will make your mother’s skin happy.  A base product that goes well with all skin types is rose water.  You can add other ingredients to enhance its properties.  For sensitive skin, add witch hazel extract to the toner.  For acne-prone skin, add tea tree oil.  You can make tea tree water by mixing water with oil.  If your mom has dry skin, make sure to add coconut oil to your toner.  Final Thoughts This Mother’s Day, deepen the bond you have with your mom with a gift that expresses your gratitude.",
    "R01046": "So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils. Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin.  So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion.  But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion.  Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils.  Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well.  So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc.  Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.",
    "R01047": "You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries. Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.  Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container.  Enjoy your new scented body lotion.

How to use this list: These functional exercises are demonstrated by Jess Movold, NASM-certified trainer and Runner’s World+ Run Coach.  Prior to a run, spend about 30 to 60 seconds performing each dynamic stretch (quad stretches, hip openers and hamstring scoops).  On strength training days, perform each exercise with body weight only for 30 seconds, or load the exercises such as the squats and lunges with enough resistance that you can only perform 10 reps before needing a rest break.  Perform 2 to 3 sets of 10 at this resistance level to improve strength and prevent running related injuries.  [ Runner’s World 10-Minute Cross-Training, gives you five muscle-building routines that take just 10 minutes to get you stronger.]  Dynamic Stretches: Dynamic stretches are functional exercises because they are typically performed in positions and movement patterns similar to those needed to perform a daily task specific to runners.  According to research identified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), dynamic stretching has been shown to improve running performance.",
    "R01049": "A demonstrator demanding Nixon's impeachment, October 1973 In July 1973, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system and recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing executive privilege.  With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the \" Saturday Night Massacre \"; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski.  In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that a tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972, had an 18 1⁄2 minute gap.  Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked.  The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.  Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.",
    "R01050": "Kissinger noted similarities between Nixon's opening of China in 1972 and President Donald Trump's Middle East diplomacy. Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that \"Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena.  While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships both with Communist China and with the Soviet Union.\"  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  In surveys of historians and political scientists, Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president.  During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate.  Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks restored the president's power.  Personality and public image Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it.",
    "R01051": "Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation.  He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation.  This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence.  Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”?  Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment?  In this paper, I plan to do two things.  First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives.  Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.",
    "R01052": "We are living in a reality in which posthumans have not developed yet and we are actually living in reality. We will have no way of knowing that we live in a simulation because we will never reach the technological capacity to realize the marks of a simulated reality.  Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.  If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.  Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation.  For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: \"You are living in a simulation.

    "R01054": "Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life. This might also result in inability to empathize.  These sites make kids prone to sensationalism.  A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall.  Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media.  A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison.  This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence.  However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships.  Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”.  After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody.  Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.",

Unsurprisingly, customers had to share usernames and passwords for each account with these aggregators making the whole system vulnerable to privacy risks.  Early “open banking” projects were scraping data from shared sources, but the records were often incomplete and provided only a partial picture.  These projects were difficult and expensive to support: If a bank decided to redesign its application, scraping became impossible.  Open banking APIs solve that problem by providing access to standardized data in a secure manner.  Payment Services Directive Explained So, what is PSD2?  The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a legal framework that regulates payment services through the EU and EEA (European Economic Area).  The directive supports innovation and development of an integrated payment market across Europe.  The new regulatory document was adopted in October 2015.  It was a logical extension of the original PSD, which was designed in 2007 to increase competition across the payment industry.  The new directive is focused on making cross-border payments easy and secure.  PSD2 integrates open banking and APIs with the financial business industry ecosystem.

While the open banking model in the United States may take a different path, US banks can learn valuable lessons by looking at how it has been implemented in more regulatory-driven environments.  Bank leaders may find it particularly helpful to review how different regions set technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing.  To date, there are no signs that new open banking regulations are being developed in the United States.  In 2018, the US Treasury Department stated that there are significant differences between the United Kingdom and the United States, “with respect to the size, nature, and diversity of the financial services sector and regulatory mandates,” and as such, “an equivalent open banking regime for the US market is not readily applicable.”  12 This implies that the US banking industry is likely to pursue an industry-driven approach.  However, policymakers and regulators have issued recommendations encouraging banks to adopt best practices.  Banks, large and small, are developing APIs to facilitate a safe means to exchange banking data and move away from less secure, screen-scraping methods.",
    "R01066": "Gas-generator cycle  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle.   There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.   The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine.  This is seen in the F-1 rocket engine used on the Saturn V booster stage.   As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).",
    "R01067": "Electric pump-fed An electric motor, generally a brushless DC electric motor, drives the pumps. The electric motor is powered by a battery pack.  It is relatively simple to implement and reduces the complexity of the turbomachinery design, but at the expense of the extra dry mass of the battery pack.  Example engine is the Rutherford designed and used by Rocket Lab.  Gas-generator cycle A small percentage of the propellants are burnt in a preburner to power a turbopump and then exhausted through a separate nozzle, or low down on the main one.  This results in a reduction in efficiency since the exhaust contributes little or no thrust, but the pump turbines can be very large, allowing for high power engines.  Examples: Saturn V 's F-1 and J-2, Delta IV 's RS-68, Ariane 5 's HM7B, Falcon 9 's Merlin.  Tap-off cycle Takes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump propellant, then is exhausted.  Since not all propellant flows through the main combustion chamber, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine.  Examples include the J-2S and BE-3.  Expander cycle Cryogenic fuel (hydrogen, or methane) is used to cool the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle.",
    "R01068": "Reefs appear to act as sinks for carbon dioxide over geological time scales, but are net sources of carbon dioxide in time perspectives relevant for humans ( Gattuso et al., 1996, Hallock, 1997 ). This net source seems to be of minor significance in the current global carbon budget ( Gattuso et al., 1996 ), as it has been estimated that the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere from human activities the last 100 years is larger than release from reefs in 15 000 years ( Hallock, 1997 ).  Buddemeier (1996) claims that those reefs which are sinks for carbon dioxide are subject to human impact, and have an increased ratio of organic production to calcification compared with normal reefs.  Biochemical processes on coral reefs play a significant role in the world's calcium balance (e.g. Kühlmann, 1988 ).  Reefs precipitate approximately half of the 1.2×10 13 mol of calcium delivered to the sea each year ( Smith, 1978 ).  In addition to the reef building corals there are also algae and foraminifera on coral reefs that produce CaCO 3 ( Wiebe, 1988 ).

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.  How many different species live in reefs?  What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms.  Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology.  When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs.  5.  Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.",

Flooding due to more intense rainstorms, impacts on public health due to heat and vector-related illness such as West Nile virus, and impacts on snow sports as well as salmon and other fisheries are likely to increase as the climate warms up. Cumulative economic effects are usually larger than the sum of obvious individual sector effects, such as those listed above.  This is because of interactions between industries and economic sectors which depend on each other.  As one industry declines, another may follow.  Caveat The report bases the cost assessment on gradual warming.  However, if temperature thresholds are crossed at the global level this could trigger abrupt changes in climate conditions.  If this happens, the economic costs of such changes would be much higher.",

Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.

Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, So Tom and Prncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - they have been called \"forced riders\" as opposed to the \"free riders\".  Internationally there is recognition of this issue, which is known under the term \"climate justice\".  It has been a key topic at the United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP).   During the Cancn COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.  However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming.  Emmanuel Macron (President of France) said at the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn (COP 23): \"Climate change adds further injustice to an already unfair world\".

    "R01265": "The 3 Biggest Myths About Running in the Morning on an Empty Stomach. Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.",

Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information that would damage the FBI, as well as other powerful people and institutions.  In the \"smoking gun\" tape, Nixon's chief of staff, H.R.

Speculation in the press and the public It had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man.  Using this and other widespread clues, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat.  For instance, George V.

Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting \"neural ancestor simulations\" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's \"ancestor simulations\", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.   Some scholars categorically reject or are uninterested in anthropic reasoning, dismissing it as \"merely philosophical\", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific.

Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital.  Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s.  A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time.  The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return.  This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return.  Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme.  How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example.  Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month.  The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month.  The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest.

The various Dragon capsules use the  Draco  and  SuperDraco  engines.  The Dracos use a hypergolic fuel which means that you mix two chemicals and they spontaneously combust - without needing any kind of ignition source.  Both rockets use monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.  When they fire, the exhaust is a very characteristic bright orange.  The StarShip and SuperHeavy use the Raptor engines.  Raptor uses liquid Methane (LCH4) as the fuel with liquid Oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer (this is sometimes called Methalox).  WHY SWITCH TO METHANE?  The switch from RP-1 to Methane comes about because SpaceX want to fly StarShip to Mars - and if they do that, there wont be enough room on board to store enough fuel to get home again.  The nice thing about Methane is that it can be made from CO2 and Hydrogen - plus a good supply of electricity.  The atmosphere on Mars is almost all CO2, and hydrogen may be obtained by the electrolysis of water - which is fairly plentiful as ice below the surface of Mars.",
    "R01302": "Heres why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. | ProVsCons. Its melting point is -259C or -435F, and its boiling point is -252C or -423F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogens low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earths re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rockets fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.",
    "R01303": "Turbopumps for Liquid Rocket Engines | Aircraft Technology. Engine Requirements Liquid rocket engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, depending on the mission requirements. If the mission velocity and payload are low, the propellants are fed to the thrust chamber by pressurizing the vehicle tanks.  As the mission velocity requirement increases, the chamber pressure must be increased to raise the thrust from each pound of propellant in order to increase the vehicle thrust-to-weight ratio.  This justifies the added complexity of the turbopumps to minimize the vehicle tank weight.  The type of engine cycle selected also influences the turbopump requirements and configuration.  Generally, three types of engine cycles have been used in liquid rocket engines: the gas generator cycle, the staged combustion cycle and the expander cycle.  The engine cycle terminology refers to the source of energy to drive the turbine.  Gas Generator Cycle In a gas generator cycle engine, the turbine flow is in parallel with the thrust chamber and is not used to develop thrust.  Sufficient propellants to drive the turbine are removed from the pump discharge, combusted in the gas generator, and expanded through the turbine to atmospheric pressure.  The required pump discharge pressure is established by the combustion chamber injection pressure and establishes the available pressure to drive the turbine.",

Stretch It Out \"Your head is heavy like a bowling ball,\" Moen says, so holding it out and up in front of you (as you do on a road bike) can overextend and stiffen neck and back muscles.  And the longer any given ride is, the more your bod's bound to hurt afterward.  \"You wouldn't expect to go for a two-hour run and not be sore the next day,\" he adds, \"but people always seem surprised when it happens to them on a bike.\"  To loosen up post-ride, bring your hands to meet behind your low back and clasp them together.  Stretch for 30 seconds, alternating chin-to-chest, ears-to-shoulders, and looking left and right.  Keep in mind these types of aches and pains are more common in newbies, so as with any sport, your muscles will adapt and hurt less as your body gets used to longer rides.  5.

Could the magical and mystical elements of Doctor Strange be used as the groundwork for introducing Moon Knight?  Or will Marvel opt for someone else entirely ?  Regardless of who Marvel chooses, Phase 4 will surely feature a standalone film for a new character.  5 It will feature more diverse casts than any phase before it One area in which Marvel has received criticism in the past is in its lack of representation of minorities in its films.  Though Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has been a stalwart in the MCU thus far, the Avengers themselves have lacked diversity.  The studio received backlash when it cast Ben Kingsley to play the role of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 (though it would receive even fiercer backlash when the film's twist revealed his true character to be Trevor Slattery) and again when the role of the Ancient One was filled by Tilda Swinton.  On the topic of diversity, Kevin Feige said \"I think that in the movies we've already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.  For us, it's important that we don't feel like a completely white, European cast.\"",

This Fridays Black Panther spotlights the Oscar-winning Lupita Nyongo as Nakia, a Wakandan spy who fights alongside the title character and his fierce all-female special forces unit, the Dora Milaje.  For the Kenyan-raised Nyongo, its a chance to escape the veil of CGI effects in Disneys Jungle Book and Star Wars franchise and play a high-profile partin a film that celebrates Africa.

But whether inadvertently or intentionally, Pine and his tongue-in-cheek monologue once again highlighted Hollywoods diversity problem, particularly when it comes to big-budget superhero movies.Whereas Marvel Comics has made strides in including more female and minority main characters in its comic books, the company faced backlash last month afterDavid Gabriel, a vice president of sales, suggested that diversity was causing sales to slide. What we heard was that people didnt want any more diversity.  They didnt want female characters out there, Gabriel said at the Marvel Retailer Summit,according to Entertainment Weekly.  We saw the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new, our female characters, anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up against.  That was difficult for us because we had a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas that we were trying to get out and nothing new really worked.

Intentionally broadening and maintaining your network is one of the most important steps you can take to increase your chances of professional success. Why is networking important?  Networking allows you access to opportunities you might not be able to find on your own.  Your network has the potential to provide you with insight into different fields, information on what potential employers look for and advice on how you can improve professionally.  If you are willing to form and maintain the relationship, a single contact could get you into meetings or interviews with several companies without you having to work to form connections at each one.  Effective networking can save you time, effort and stress, so knowing how to use it effectively can be a powerful tool for your professional development.  Networking can be beneficial in three specific ways: 1.  The importance of networking in the workplace One of the most obvious places to grow your network is in your workplace.  Connections like these can provide you with referrals, job leads, mentoring and practical training.

By my observation thats not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines). There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideologymore accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they dont espouse and away from data and opinion thats inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people dont appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who dont notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative theyre hearingthey know its skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the other side of the story wont come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.

These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to \"racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.\"  The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.  Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender.  Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles.  Additionally, Nobles argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.  Many new technological systems promote themselves as progressive and unbiased, Noble is arguing against this point and saying that many technologies, including google's algorithm \"reflect and reproduce existing inequities.\"  Chapter Summaries Chapter 1  In Chapter 1 of Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble explores how Google searchs auto suggestion feature is demoralizing.",

If a country has more bloggers they are more likely to link to fellow blogs within that country.  Throw in personalisation, in which geographic location is taken into account, this further reinforces country specific blogger-linked networks.  This is why .com ccTLDs rank more than other ccTLDs and why many marketers and business people alike want .com  domains over other ccTLDs.  This is a classic example of success-breeds-success whereby the US has the upper-hand due to the fact of it being an early adopter of the web.  3) Impartiality Search engines may think of themselves as being objective but like any other media company, editorial judgements are made and are factored into automated operations.  Engines trust certain sources more than others.  On Google, Wikipedia has been regarded as a trustworthy source.  This may be because Wikipedia contains up-to-date, current and reliable information that answers a question through well-researched, referenced, thus reliable, content.  As a result it often features in the top results.  If the top results do not satisfy the searcher, the search is unsuccessful.

When that shroud was lifted, however, Madoff's investment fund stood revealed as a classic Ponzi scheme: a con game in which the illusion of solvency was created by paying off early investors with capital raised from later entrants. As long as new investment continued to come in the door, the earlier adopters reaped fat rewards; once markets tumbled and investors withdrew, however, the whole thing collapsed like a house of cards.  Though a Boston businessman named Charles Ponzi was the scam's namesake, he wasn't its original practitioner.  According to Mitchell Zuckoff, a Ponzi biographer, the reigning king of the \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" scam was a New York grifter named William Miller, who bilked investors out of $1 million  nearly $25 million in today's dollars  in 1899.  After drumming up interest by claiming to have an inside window into the way profitable companies operated, Miller  who earned the nickname \"520 percent\" due to the astonishing rate of return he promised investors over the course of a year  salted his scam by paying out the first few investors.  After his racket was exposed by a newspaper investigation, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  According to Zuckoff, his creditors got just 28 cents back for every dollar they'd invested.",

Jamie Piromalli formed World Vision Entertainment, Inc., as a Florida corporation in 1994, to promote itself as an entertainment investment company.  In 1996, World Vision started selling nine-month promissory notes with annualized interest rates varying between 10.9 and 11.9 percent.  Investors could collect their interest monthly or at the end of the nine-month term in a lump sum together with their principal investment.  Although the notes were unsecured, investors received a certificate of insurance promising full repayment if World Vision defaulted.  At the expiration of each nine-month term, World Vision encouraged investors to reinvest their principal for additional nine-month terms.  Between June 1996 and September 1999, World Vision sold ninemonth notes totaling approximately $62 million in 33 states to approximately 1,200 investors.

No Antibiotics or Growth Hormones Cattle that are raised on grassy plains, eating grass, are much less likely to acquire or spread disease compared to the feed lot cattle of the United States, which are primarily fed grains such as corn. Therefore, they needn't be pumped full of antibiotics to stave off infections.  Cows aren't meant to eat corn, and when they do they become more susceptible to health problems.  But the point of feeding them grains is to fatten them up as quickly as possible, which is why grain-fed beef is more likely to be pumped full of growth hormones too.  Traditionally-raised pampas cattle aren't unnaturally rushed in this way, resulting in much higher quality meat.  Cut to Texture In addition to the way Argentinian beef is raised, the way it's butchered contributes to its superior flavor.

This prevents overpacking and makes your whole setup much lighter.  In fact, some riders consider this to be the only reason that bikepacking bags are lighter than panniers.  If your bikepacking bags tear, you can repair them yourself Because bikepacking bags are made of fabric, you can easily repair holes with a needle and thread.  A small sewing kit is lightweight and takes up very little space.  You can even use the same sewing kit that you use for tubeless tire repair.",

From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man | GamesRadar+ Home Features Best Marvel movies  ranked!  From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man By GamesRadar Staff 5 months ago Look back on a decade of the best Marvel movies  now with added Spider-Man: Far From Home!  (Image credit: Disney/Marvel)  With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect.  There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable.  But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible  we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time.  The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other  so there's loads of choice.  The good news is you can stream most of the MCU on Disney Plus now, and there's never been a better time to get caught up as new series launch on Disney Plus throughout the year, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.",

Although we didnt get the multiverse of parallel worlds in the MCU that was teased in early previews of the film, we did get confirmation that Tony Stark, Captain America, Black Widow, and Vision are all presumed dead by the general public in Marvels movie-verse.  The film also indicated that the Avengers havent assembled a new lineup in the aftermath of Endgame yet.  Maybe most importantly, however, is that the film revealed that the shape-changing Skrulls  first introduced in Captain Marvel  have been on Earth for an unknown period of time.  That means that nearly any character in the MCU could have been a Skrull at some point in the movies, given that Captain Marvel, which unfolded in the mid-1990s, takes place before all of them.  Whats rumored and whats missing Marvels Phase 4 lineup is lacking several key franchises.  Theres no Spider-Man, no Ant-Man and the Wasp, and most surprisingly, no Avengers.",

Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.

Passing such a bill would be a tall order politically, even if Democrats take back the Senate as well as the White House next year.  A decade ago, the Obama administration unsuccessfully tried to pass into law its own enforcement mechanism for reducing emissions in the form of a cap-and-trade scheme that would have set up a market in which companies could buy and sell credits permitting them to release carbon into the atmosphere.",

    "R01698": "Here's what to do during your break. Make it last.  Take at least one three- or four-week break each year.  Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training.  Time it right.  The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes.  Stay in shape.  During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times.  For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started).  Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do.  For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout.  The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity.  In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness.  You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.",

Incredibly, the scandal had been secretly taped.  And one of the tapes had a gap!  An 18 and a half minute gap!  Which Nixon blamed on Rose Mary Woods, his secretary.  Riiiiiiiiight.  The astonishing hypothesis of the Watergate scandal was that the Nixon White House had corruption in its DNA -- that the abuse of power was a routine matter for the administration, and that the president’s natural paranoia, his insecurity, his trickiness, had generated a malevolence and criminality that had spread to every root and twig of the organism.  The president had his defenders, of course, including one of my senators from Florida, Ed Gurney, who served on the Ervin committee.  The ranking Republican, Howard Baker, seemed committed to the truth no matter where it led him.  Sam Ervin, the chairman, was a lovable, simple country lawyer, as he put it.

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.

For example, get a copy of \"Our Man Flint,\" the greatest satire of the James Bond movies.  In it, the \"M\"/\"CIA Director\" character was always finding bugs, and it was clearly implied that the President was behind it.  This would not have been as funny AFTER Watergate.  Secondly, the nation was in the chaos of the Sixties.  It was the best and worst of times, but for the Nixon administration it was the worst.

    "R01711": "Nixon famously asserted executive privilege to block the release of tapes capturing his coverup of the Watergate scandal, defying a congressional subpoena ordering him to turn most of them over. The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.  At first, he gave Congress 19 tapes — but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.  In a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him.  “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said on April 29, 1974.  He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove “irrelevant” information that was not subject to Congress’s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns and promising that the rest would be sufficient.  But to House leaders, it wasn’t.  Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said that “we will accept nothing less” than the tapes — and months later, they got them.

The generally accepted theory is that in the mid-1800s, the African slaves who had been brought to Argentina or their descendants began to influence the local culture.  The word “tango” may be straightforwardly African in origin, meaning “closed place” or “reserved ground.”  Or it may derive from Portuguese (and from the Latin verb tanguere, to touch) and was picked up by Africans on the slave ships.  Whatever its origin, the word “tango” had acquired the standard meaning of the place where African slaves and free blacks gathered to dance by the time Argentina banned slavery in 1853.  During the later part of the 1800s and early 1900s, Argentina was undergoing a massive immigration.  In 1869, Buenos Aires had a population of 180,000.  By 1914, its population was 1.5 million.

In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real.  This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers.  Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell.  All this led to a sharp reduction in exports.  As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998.  Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy.  In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket.  Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime.

Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas.  After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.  The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle or preburner cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages.  The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity .  Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.  In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce thrust .  The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust.",

This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ISP and better system performance.  A liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling, which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle.",

This not only slows the booster down, but it also basically creates a “force field” in front of the booster, providing a boundary of exhaust gas which is a lot cooler than the plasma.  Without this step, the Falcon 9 booster would likely not survive the reentry process.  Parachute recovery attempts After all, SpaceX tried to recover the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 boosters using parachutes for the first few flights, which kept failing, likely due to a complete lack of additional heat shielding.

    "R01755": "Merlin uses chilled RP-1 (which stands for “Rocket Propellant 1” and is basically kerosene) with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. The various Dragon capsules use the “ Draco ” and “ SuperDraco ” engines.  The Draco’s use a “hypergolic” fuel which means that you mix two chemicals and they spontaneously combust - without needing any kind of ignition source.  Both rockets use monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.  When they fire, the exhaust is a very characteristic bright orange.  The StarShip and SuperHeavy use the “Raptor” engines.  Raptor uses liquid Methane (LCH4) as the fuel with liquid Oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer (this is sometimes called “Methalox”).  WHY SWITCH TO METHANE?  The switch from RP-1 to Methane comes about because SpaceX want to fly StarShip to Mars - and if they do that, there won’t be enough room on board to store enough fuel to get home again.  The nice thing about Methane is that it can be made from CO2 and Hydrogen - plus a good supply of electricity.  The atmosphere on Mars is almost all CO2, and hydrogen may be obtained by the electrolysis of water - which is fairly plentiful as ice below the surface of Mars.",
    "R01756": "In most rocket engines fueled by liquid hydrogen, it first cools the nozzle and other parts before being mixed with the oxidizer — usually liquid oxygen (LOX) — and burned to produce water with traces of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Practical H–O rocket engines run fuel-rich so that the exhaust contains some unburned hydrogen.  This reduces combustion chamber and nozzle erosion.  It also reduces the molecular weight of the exhaust, which can actually increase specific impulse, despite the incomplete combustion.   Liquid hydrogen can be used as the fuel for an internal combustion engine or fuel cell.  Various submarines (Type 212 submarine, Type 214 submarine) and concept hydrogen vehicles have been built using this form of hydrogen (see DeepC, BMW H2R).  Due to its similarity, builders can sometimes modify and share equipment with systems designed for liquefied natural gas (LNG).  However, because of the lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large.  Unless direct injection is used, a severe gas-displacement effect also hampers maximum breathing and increases pumping losses.   Liquid hydrogen is also used to cool neutrons to be used in neutron scattering.  Since neutrons and hydrogen nuclei have similar masses, kinetic energy exchange per interaction is maximum (elastic collision).",
    "R01757": "Coral reefs are endangered by natural phenomena such as hurricanes, El Nino, and diseases; local threats including overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, coastal development, pollution, and careless tourism; and the global effects of climate change—warming seas and increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. According to Reefs at Risk Revisited, a recent report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), 75% of the world’s coral reefs are at risk from local and global stresses.  Ten percent of coral reefs have already been damaged beyond repair, and if we continue with business as usual, WRI projects that 90% of coral reefs will be in danger by 2030, and all of them by 2050.  Coral reefs are colonies of individual animals called polyps, which are related to sea anemones.  The polyps, which have tentacles to feed on plankton at night, play host to zooxanthellae, symbiotic algae that live within their tissues and give the coral its color.  The coral provides CO2 and waste products that the algae need for photosynthesis.  In turn, the algae nourish the coral with oxygen and the organic products of photosynthesis.  The coral uses these compounds to synthesize calcium carbonate (limestone) with which it constructs its skeleton—the coral reef.",
    "R01758": "What Happens When Coral Reefs Die – Blane Perun's TheSea Credit: Blane Perun What Happens When Coral Reefs Die December 7, 2017 March 10, 2021 Blane Perun In most cases, the answer to the question of what happens when coral reefs die is that they are simply replaced by other coral polyp larvae, which go on to mature and form new reef formations.  This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.",
    "R01759": "The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.  The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.  Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.  Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves.  Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life.  Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.  Climate change impacts on the environment Ecological collapse.  Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide.  Extreme weather.

    "R01760": "Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.",

When   these   organisms   die,   their   shells   and   body   parts   sink   to   the   ocean   floor   where   they   accumulate   as   carbonate-rich   deposits.

    "R01762": "The new survey of 100 major coral reefs, from 1980 through 2016, found only a handful that had not suffered severe bleachings during that period. More striking, it found that the rate of severe bleaching is increasing over time.   The average reef in the group bleached severely once every 25 or 30 years at the beginning of the 1980s, but by 2016 the recurrence time for severe bleaching was just 5.9 years.  The study said that as ocean waters have grown steadily warmer, global bleaching events are now triggered not only in warm water El Nino years, but potentially in any year, including cooler La Nina years.  The change has occurred during about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of overall global warming so far, highlighting the fact that corals — whose existence, based on an ancient symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, evolved millions of years ago — are a particularly sensitive system.

    "R01774": "Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  \"Relevance\" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, there is now 10 percent less permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, in the Northern Hemisphere than there was in the early 1900s.  The thawing of permafrost can cause landslides and other sudden land collapses.  It can also release long-buried microbes, as in a 2016 case when a cache of buried reindeer carcasses thawed and caused an outbreak of anthrax.",

And the future problems caused by rising seas, growing deserts, and more frequent droughts all look set to affect the developing world more than rich countries, they add.

To read more, visit Effects of climate change tallied up.  Back to Top Factors Greenhouse Gases The increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity is often cited as one of the major causes of global warming.  These greenhouse gases reabsorb heat reflected from the Earth's surface, thus trapping the heat in our atmosphere.  This natural process is essential for life on Earth because it plays an important role in regulating the Earth's temperature.  However, over the last several hundred years, humans have been artificially increasing the concentration of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane in the Earth's atmosphere.  These gases build up and prevent additional thermal radiation from leaving the Earth, thereby trapping excess heat.",

Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.",
    "R01850": "The study showed that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries. Structure The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties, which are 'top down', characterized by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound.  Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law.  This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an \"executive agreement rather than a treaty\".  Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress.  Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope.  While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this division is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties are required to submit emissions reductions plans.",

Railway building within Argentina and the invention of refrigerated trains and ships in the late 19th century made an export market and Argentina's beef export industry started to thrive.  The flipped seasons between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meant that Argentine beef came onto the market at a time of year when beef was less at hand in the Northern Hemisphere, which further lifted the potential export market in the United States and European markets.  Following the rising demand for high-quality beef, new breeds and selective crossbreeding have been developed.  Argentine beef and its production have played a major part in the culture of Argentina, from the asado to the history of the gauchos of the Pampas.

NASA budgets, however, were becoming increasingly constrained, and at a January conference at NASA Headquarters administrators reluctantly agreed that there should be no new launch vehicle development in order to reduce the budget problems.  The year, 1967, passed without any real progress in the development of a reusable spacecraft, but financial pressures became greater rather than less.  In January 1968, George Mueller rekindled sentiments for work on a reusable spacecraft as potentially a cost-saving measure: Where we stand now is the feasibility generally has been established for reusability.  And we have much data on many concepts.  We have an uncertain market demand and operational requirements.  The R&D costs for fully reusable systems, including incremental development approaches, appear high.  Personnel and cargo spacecraft seem to dominate Earth-to-orbit logistics costs.

Raptor However, with Starship development, SpaceX has cranked everything up to 11.  In search of the best rocket engine ever made, they developed a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine known as Raptor.  The reason it is so complicated is that all of the exhaust gas that would normally be dumped overboard after spinning the turbine is instead routed into the main combustion chamber and used for thrust.  Not only that, but there are two of those little rocket engines – each with their own turbines and pumps.  The exhausts from which are pumped into the main combustion chamber.

    "R01868": "As we’ve mentioned, calcium carbonate is one of the ways that CO2 is taken out of the ocean, and that is because it becomes apart of shells, corals and other marine life. When any of these die, they end up on the ocean floor.  So over millions and millions of years, the dead marine life moves with the tectonic plates.  Under heat and pressure, this calcium carbonate ends up becoming rocks (such as limestone), so we end up with a lot of CO2 eventually ending up in stone.  So to sum: CO2 ends up in the oceans (which is already where most of it is contained), some gets formed into shells and corals which end up as stone or fuel (organic matter over millions of years), and by using this organic matter we’re pumping it back into the atmosphere.  As such, it seems quite reasonable that we should just be able to pump it back into the oceans to help keep this cycle continuing for millions of years more.  However, we’ve found that an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean increases the pH levels.  For anyone that has ever had a tropical fish in a tank, they well understand how important it is to keep the correct pH levels.  Advertisement Advertisement So what is all the fuss about?",

This figure shows the mean annual air temperature from 1815 to date as recorded at the Radcliffe Meteorological Station.  Two interesting facts are apparent from the Radcliffe temperature time series: In the 20th century temperatures were generally higher than in the 19th century.  This is thought to be an effect of the urban heat island.  With the development of the city, more open spaces were built up.  This process produced radical changes in the nature of the surface and atmospheric properties of the city.  Differences in surface materials, drainage characteristics, sources of heat, configuration of surfaces and pollution acted to change all aspects of the climate of the city, air temperature being affected particularly strongly.  Urban heat island effect is the most common example of inadvertent climatic modification.  The post-1986 decade was the warmest decade on record.  This fact may be an effect of the interannual climatic variability, or it may be suggestive of climate change.  Only time will tell!

    "R01943": "The increase in frequency of these extreme events affect the stability of food supplies and thus food security. When food supplies get damaged by weather, access to food also becomes damaged.  When developing countries are faced with extreme events, and certain crops can no longer be produced due to sustainability, the access to certain foods, such as cereals and exotic fruits, become unavailable to the people living in developed countries.  The areas that will be mostly affected by crop failure are found in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia.  This means that the regions that will be exposed to the highest degree of instability in food production are the poorest regions in developing countries.  Climate change will affect all dimensions of food security, in particular food availability, access to food, and stability of food supplies.

Turkey is listed as an an industrialised developed country in the 1992 UN climate change convention.  The rationale for this demand is that as a developing country Turkey can access climate funds, which are otherwise unavailable to industrialised countries.

The conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for the Paris Agreement.   On November 8, 2016, four days after the Paris Agreement entered into force in the United States, Donald Trump of the Republican Party was elected President of the United States.  Many conservative Republicans dispute the level of human involvement in climate change.  Trump is a climate change sceptic, who in 2012 tweeted that he believed the concept of global warming was created by China in order to impair American competitiveness.  During Trump's 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to revitalize the coal industry, which he claimed has been hampered by environmental regulations.  It has been argued that this contributed to the support he enjoyed from crucial swing states.  His opposition to climate change mitigation was unchanged in the first months of his presidency, in which he issued an executive order to reverse Obama's Clean Power Plan and other environmental regulations.   In April 2017, a group of 20 members of the European Parliament from the right-wing Alternative for Germany, UK Independence Party, and other parties sent a letter to Trump on urging him to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.

While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.

This was prior to the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents.  These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire-taps and recording equipment.  Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted.  As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested.  The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders.  Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security.  The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.  By January 1973, the Watergate intruders stood trial for their participation in the break-in.

John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors.  When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders.  In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in.  The dominoes were now falling one by one.  In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate.  Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up.

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better.  Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better.  Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless.  Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy.  Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate.  On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof.  Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg decide which Jollof tastes better.  Hilarious!

The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area.   Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.  By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.  They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.   Section::::Later history.   The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.

However, rather than actually making any investments, Ponzi simply pocketed the investors money for himself.  He was able to continue the scam by attracting new investors and using part of their money to pay returns to earlier investors.  In return, the earlier investors would help Ponzi attract new investors by bragging about the amazing returns they were earning with him.  However, ultimately, Ponzi got to the point where he couldnt attract enough new investors to pay off the growing number of previous investors.  At that point, the scam was discovered, and it fell apart.  Step-by-Step Process  Ponzi Scheme The fraudster attracts an investor by promising them extraordinary returns on investment.  As an example, assume the perpetrator of the Ponzi scheme gets an initial investor to give him $1 million to invest, promising a return of 25% or better.

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors.  A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors.

Both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around.  At that point, the schemes unravel.

You are not alone if you desire to have one mate throughout your life (monogamy), and believe that comes natural to humans, nor are you alone if you desire to have many loves (polyamory), and believe that is what comes natural to humans.  As a marriage therapist and relationship expert, it is my opinion, based on working with couples, individuals, and families since 1993 that this is not an either-or debate as many position this topic to be.  It is not either-or as to whether men and women are, or are not, meant/built for multiple mates or whether they are, or are not, meant/built for one mate.  Are men and women built to be monogamous or polyamorous?  It is this relationship experts stance that men and women are built naturally to desire connection, long for connection, need connection, and thrive when connected with another. Males who have recently copulated will not transfer as many nutrients to their next mate, but will spend a longer duration of time for each mating. This increases the mating costs for females because they are spending more time copulating and receiving fewer nutrients from the ejaculate.",

But by launching reusable rockets, having smaller engines is part of success.  That was Elon Musk and SpaceXs strategy, from the already veteran Merlin engines to the newer Raptor engines, which are expected to be used in the Starship Super Heavy, the ship that aims to reach Mars.  The first test of the Merlin 1A took place in 2006.  An engine made of polymers reinforced with carbon fibers which in its first test failed miserably.  A year later, it was used in Falcon 1, kicking off the first private launch of liquid-fueled vehicles to orbit the Earth.  Since then, these Merlin engines have accompanied SpaceX in its conquest of space.  Elon Musk believes that the launch of a modern rocket is based on use a large number of motors at the same time, controlled at the same time, which allow the thrust to be varied in real time and with a key advantage: reliability.  Because if one of the engines fails, the rest stays. The booster is the bottom portion of the rocket that houses 9 of its engines, standing about 160 feet",

Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  Its because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Lets elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  Its a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.

    "R02002": "Because of all these reasons, SpaceX chose rocket grade Kerosene for their Falcon rockets. Drawbacks of Kerosene (RP-1) Propellant: Kerosene produces soot, coking, and polymerization inside the Merlin engine.  As a result, after each rocket launch, SpaceX needs to clean its rocket engine thoroughly.  This process is costly and prevents SpaceX from reusing their rocket in rapid succession.  Though Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavys Merlin engine uses liquid Kerosene, the Starships Raptor engine uses liquid Methane (CH4) as fuel.  Methane burns cleanly and far superior fuel for reusable rockets.  Nowadays, liquid Methane (CH4) is a commonly used rocket propellant.  However, it was not as prevalent before 2007.  SpaceX is building the Starship to send payload and humans to Mars.  Though there is no Methane on Mars, we can manufacture Methane via the Sabatier process.  In this process, we need to mix Carbon Dioxide (CO2) with Hydrogen (H) and then heat the mixture to produce Methane (CH4) and Water (H2O.)

The Scramjet engine uses hydrogen as a fuel (which it carries with it completely) and uses oxygen from the atmosphere as an oxidizer that is necessary to burn hydrogen.  Advantages of Scramjet Engine:  Lightweight will reduce the space expenditure by up to 90 percent due to the lighter weight of the current rocket.   More payload can be sent by a rocket.   Rockets can be reused.   With the help of Scramjet technology, the rocket can move at 6 times the speed.   Large size satellites can also be sent with a small rocket.

The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber.  The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries.  An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor.  The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent it from overheating.  The electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps.  This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.

The color is due to the symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae algae, which produce color pigments.  Corals need warm, clear water (without sediments).  Introduction: Reefs consists of corals and other organisms made of calcium carbonate and are home to many colorful fishes.  Coral reefs have a wide variety of calcareous corals that ultimately get broken up into fragments through physical weathering, which are then deposited helping to create the magnificent reefs you see.  The most common type of coral today is the Scleractinia.  Coral reefs are the rainforest of the sea with great diversity, but are highly threatened due to climate change and human impact.  Corals have slow growth rates and can take thousands of years to grow and regrow if disturbed.  Waves, or the water movement along fish such as Parrot Fish help break down carbonate shells and corals forming sand on bottom.  Parrot fish help the coral reefs stay clean and eat up dead coral. Typically, scleractinian coral polyps are characterized as having sets of six tentacles, septa, and mesenteries. The tentacles encircle the mouth and are used in defense and the capturing of prey.  They contain stinging cells called nematocysts.  These poison-injecting cells are used to incapacitate small",
    "R02007": "Competition can happen between members of the same species (intraspecific competition) and between different species (interspecific competition). An example of interspecific competition in the ocean is the relationship between corals and sponges.  Sponges are very abundant in coral reefs.  If they become too successful, however, they take needed food and other resources from the corals that make up the reef.  Sponges may outcompete corals for resources in the short term, but if too many corals die, the reef itself becomes damaged.  This is bad for the sponges, which may themselves begin to die off until the reef is balanced again.  Symbiotic relationships can be useful measures of an ecosystems health.  For example, large tracts of coral reefs are severely damaged or dead because of recent increases in ocean temperature due to climate change.  The temperature increase induces coral to expel the algae that live mutualistically within them.  Without their algae, the coral turn white and die.  This loss of symbiosis is an early sign of declining coral health and speaks to the importance not only of studying symbiosis within marine environments, but also of examining the negative impacts that humans can have on these interactions.  In the words of National Geographic Explorer Sylvia Earle: We need to respect the oceans and take care of them as if our lives depend on it.

It flips the script on the stale chestnut that studios, networks or shows somehow cant find qualified women and people of color.  That canard suggests that members of underrepresented groups either dont really want the jobs from which theyve historically been excluded or havent worked hard enough to acquire the necessary skills for the work.  The quality argument puts the onus back on Hollywood executives, pointing to the flaws in their mechanisms for finding talent and highlighting the opportunities theyre missing.  That reversed polarity applies beyond the decision-making suites in the entertainment industry, too.  While in the short term it may make sense to call attention to work because of the identity of the person who created it, in the long term, this approach risks tying the cause of diversity to inconsistent standards of quality.  Linking the diversity to quality is a stronger case: It means that diversityisnot about charity.

Although Perlmutter received $800 million in cash and $590 million in Disney stock after the acquisition, he did not want a seat on Disney's board of directors.  In September 2015, Perlmutter stopped overseeing the development of Marvel Studios.  Disney felt the studio head, Kevin Feige, should report directly to the chairman of The Walt Disney Studios, Alan Horn, so all cinematic properties of Disney, including Pixar and Lucasfilm, were under one management structure.  The restructuring was allegedly due to Feige's frustration of working with Perlmutter as well as some alleged controversial comments and actions by Perlmutter, such as replacing the casting of Terrence Howard as James Rhodes with Don Cheadle because black people look the same.  A person with knowledge of his creative approach said, Ike Perlmutter neither discriminates nor cares about diversity, he just cares about what he thinks will make money.

Writing skills are never obsolete or outdated, and being the person who communicates your teams work to the management can make your name more prominent.  Many people in tech jobs are reluctant to be the spokesperson, but those communication skills can help you distinguish yourself.  Advanced or Alternative Degree Options?  Because of the nature of the profession, computer technology is one of the most significant testing grounds for alternative education experiments.  In the tech industry, a degree is often considered less important than experience and the plain ability to do the job, so tech companies tend to have much less stringent education requirements than other industries.  To get a tech job, its more important to be able to demonstrate and document your ability in other ways, like portfolios and previous projects youve worked on.

    "R02135": "Global warming refers to surface temperature increases, while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas amounts will affect. During the late 1980s one more term entered the lexicon, global change.  This term encompassed many other kinds of change in addition to climate change.  When it was approved in 1989, the U.S. climate research program was embedded as a theme area within the U.S. Global Change Research Program.  But global warming became the dominant popular term in June 1988, when NASA scientist James E. Hansen had testified to Congress about climate, specifically referring to global warming.  He said: global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.  4 Hansen's testimony was very widely reported in popular and business media, and after that popular use of the term global warming exploded.  Global change never gained traction in either the scientific literature or the popular media.  But temperature change itself isn't the most severe effect of changing climate.  Changes to precipitation patterns and sea level are likely to have much greater human impact than the higher temperatures alone.  For this reason, scientific research on climate change encompasses far more than surface temperature change.

    "R02136": "Without a myriad of unique ecosystems and their respective diverse plant and animal life, our quality of life may become threatened. Climate Impacts To many, the term climate change feels like a buzzword that encompasses a large amount of negative impacts.  Climate means the average weather conditions in an area over a long period of timeusually 30 years or longer.  A regions climate includes systems in the air, water, land and living organisms.  Climate change is the shift or abnormal change in climate patterns.  As the planet warms quickly, mostly due to human activity, climate patterns in regions around the world will fluctuate.  Ecosystems and biodiversity will be forced to fluctuate along with the regional climate, and that could harm many species.  Bees and other pollinators are threatened by habitat loss.  You can help by planting native flowers in your yard.  Photo: Lauren Harper These climate change impacts are in part due to how we have altered land use.  Turning natural areas into cities or agricultural fields not only diminishes biodiversity, but can make warming worse by chopping down trees and plants that help cool the planet.  Changes in climate can also intensify droughts, decrease water supply, threaten food security, erode and inundate coastlines, and weaken natural resilience infrastructure that humans depend on.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.  The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history.  Currently climate change is affecting the global community in each country of the world.  Its impact affects not only national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions.  By 2018, climate change continued exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods, affecting more than 39 million of people.  Over the period 20002018, green house emissions of developed countries and economies in transitions have declined by 6.5%.  The emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013.  In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.

Section::::Nontraditional environmental challenge.:Vulnerable developing countries and developed country legacy emissions.   Some developing countries fall under the category of vulnerable to climate change.  These countries involve small, sometimes isolated, island nations, low lying nations, nations who rely on drinking water from shrinking glaciers etc.  These vulnerable countries see themselves as the victims of climate change and some have organized themselves under groups like the Climate Vulnerable Forum.  These countries seek mitigation monies from the developed and the industrializing countries to help them adapt to the impending catastrophes that they see climate change will bring upon them.  For these countries climate change is seen as an existential threat and the politics of these countries is to seek reparation and adaptation monies from the developed world and some see it as their right.

Government politics regarding climate change and many official reports on the subject usually revolve around addressing one of the following topic areas:  BULLET::::- Adaptation: social and other changes that must be undertaken to successfully adapt to climate change.

    "R02139": "4) Better reporting The Paris Agreement marks a step forward in reporting and improving transparency of finance, which is essential to ensure accountability and avoid double-counting. Developed countries committed to continue reporting every two years on finance they have provided and mobilized, but also to start reporting on public funding they intend to provide in following years.  Other countries are also encouraged to do this.  Next year, countries will commence processes to decide the specific information to be reported, when, and how it will be reviewed, as well as methodologies for determining what should count towards climate finance goals, and how to count it.  This is essential for ensuring that, as countries work to meet their goals, the predictability and quality, as well as the quantity of climate finance improves.  The Agreement also encourages developing countries to report on finance received, as well as their needs.  This can help improve tracking of funding commitments and set the level of ambition for future climate finance goals.  Next Steps The Paris Agreement makes significant progress, yet lots of work remains to increase the scale and predictability of finance necessary for achieving the Agreements ambitious aims. Long-term climate finance The long-term finance process is aimed at progressing on the mobilization and scaling up of climate finance of resources originating from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources.

It was the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.   The conference negotiated the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change, the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 parties attending it.  The agreement enters into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.  On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries signed the agreement in New York,  According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks, the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 C Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

The pain usually becomes present in the early stages of training or if the intensity has been increased too fast.  Many runners want to keep going despite the mild pain, but is it worth it to continue running with shin splints?  Shin splints is an overuse injury and occurs when to many impacts are placed on the lower leg, before the body has time to adapt to the new stress levels.  With understanding of the cause behind shin splints, it is clear that normal running schedule should not be continued.  What happens in most cases is that the injury becomes more severe and chronic, causing it to be extremely difficult to get rid of.  Sometimes a certain amount of running through the injury does give the body time to adapt, but trying to run through shin splints can also be dangerous.  In many cases the injury can be prevented by decreasing mileage or taking a few days off.  Recovering from chronic shin splints on the other hand can take months.

For those who are interested in weight loss, the AHA recommendations that adults get 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.

Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time.  The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights.  To start, your bodys weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix.  Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets.  Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.

In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.

Lactate, which builds up when you exercise above your lactate threshold, is a bonus source of fuel that your liver can turn into glucose and send back to your energy-starved muscles.  Improving Your Exercise Performance If you want to perform your best, whether it is HIIT training, weight training or any other form of moderate to intense exercise, make sure youre replenishing your glycogen stores with carbohydrates after a workout.  A drop in muscle glycogen leads to fatigue and a reduction in performance.  You cant grab a carbohydrate-rich snack an hour before a workout and expect it to supply your glycogen needs.  It takes 24 hours or so to rebuild glycogen stores once theyre depleted.  Dont forget that the effects of glycogen depletion can be addictive, especially if youre doing daily workouts.  Research also suggests theres a two-hour window after exercise where your muscles readily suck up glycogen.  Dont forget that post-workout snack!  The Bottom Line? The Effect of Carbohydrate Supplementation on Multiple Sessions and Bouts of Resistance Exercise For athletes completing multiple high-intensity strength training sessions per day, maintenance of muscle glycogen stores is critical.

United States v. Nixon (1974) Former President Richard Nixon.  Charles Tasnadi, File/AP The case: This case was triggered by the Watergate scandal, when a special prosecutor asked for tapes that President Richard Nixon had recorded in the White House.  He refused, saying he had executive privilege that allowed him to withhold sensitive information in order to maintain confidential communications and to maintain national security.  Nixon released edited versions, but not the complete tapes, leading to Nixon and the prosecutor both filing petitions to be heard in the Supreme Court.  The decision: The Supreme Court held unanimously that while there was limited executive privilege for military or diplomacy reasons, it wasn't enough in this case.  Nixon had to hand over the tapes.  The case led to Nixon's resignation, and also ensures that the president does not have unlimited privilege to withhold information from other branches of government.   Nixon initially refused to turn over the tapes claiming executive privilege and instead campaigned for the Stennis Compromise, which called for Senator John Stennis, who was essentially deaf, to translate the tapes",

    "R02169": " Nick Bostrom, Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?, 2003 The simulation argument In 2003, philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed a trilemma that he called the simulation argument. Despite the name, Bostrom's simulation argument does not directly argue that we live in a simulation; instead, Bostrom's trilemma argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true: The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero, or The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running simulations of their evolutionary history, or variations thereof, is very close to zero, or The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.   The cosmologist Sean M. Carroll argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if a civilization is capable of performing simulations, then it will likely perform many simulations, which implies that we are most likely at the lowest level of simulation (from which point one's impression will be that it is impossible to perform a simulation), which contradicts the arguer's assumption that advanced civilizations can most likely perform simulations.  Section::::Simulation hypothesis.:Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis.   Some scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that we live in a simulation) is false.  Physicist Paul Davies deploys Bostrom's",
    "R02170": "Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument as to which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so.  If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation.  In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)...  I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility # n that obtains.'  But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true.  As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.   Simulation hypothesis  The simulation hypothesis or simulation theory proposes that all of reality, including the Earth and the universe, is in fact an artificial simulation, most likely a computer simulation.  Some versions rely on the development of a simulated reality, a proposed technology that would seem realistic enough to convince its inhabitants the simulation was",

The Nature of Reality So what happens if were living in a simulation?  Some experts theorize that as the program continues to run, problems will emerge  glitches in the matrix, so to speak.  Consider the 2017 Oscars gaffe, when old-Hollywood musical La La Land was mistakenly given the award for best picture.  Cast and crew arrived on stage to deliver their speeches while chaos ensued behind the scenes, culminating in a mea culpa that announced the real winner: Moonlight .  What does this say about simulation theory?  According to The New Yorker, some philosophers  such as David Chalmers of NYU  suggest that increasingly bizarre events in the real world may be evidence that our universe is someone elses simulation.  Beyond universe simulation, these events may represent divergent points in reality; in another universe the mix-up didnt happen.  In another reality, La La Land  actually won.  Every choice, no matter how minuscule, could create its own universe.  Another option is multiverse theory, where our universe is just one of many with its own set of physical laws and properties.

Each brick in the wall is joined with mortar, a material that creates a durable bond.  However, even the strongest brick walls crumble over time.  Typically this crumbling occurs in the mortar at the joints, but the effects of erosion are repairable.  Erosion Brick walls are typically durable, but they are not impervious to erosion.  Brick and mortar expands and contracts as moisture enters and evaporates.  Over time, the natural expansion and contraction of the brick and mortar caused by water infiltration causes erosion, or crumbling of the mortar.  Eroded portions are typically chiseled out and the mortar replaced using a process called repointing.  Patching or Repointing Homeowners may repair eroding brick by patching over the old mortar without removing the crumbling sections.  This process is called tuck pointing, but it is not a long-term repair for eroding brick walls.  Tuck-pointing eroded joints provides a weak bond between old and new mortar layers.

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better.  Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better.  Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless.  Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy.  Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate.  On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof.  Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg decide which Jollof tastes better.  Hilarious!  The Ghanians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media.  You wont blame them.

    "R02195": "Bernie Madoff has become synonymous with the Ponzi scheme, in which the payment of returns to current investors come from money deposited by new investors; meanwhile, the advisor siphons off some of the money. The affinity fraud targets a group, often in combination with a Ponzi scheme, such as a religious organization or friend group, by convincing the group to go along with a scam because their friends are involved.  Other scams include misrepresenting qualifications, such as claiming experience or certifications you don't have or promising unrealistic returns, such as claiming an investment will generate huge numbers.  With a churning scam, the advisor makes lots of unnecessary trades, which costs the customer in commissions and often results in less-than-stellar investment returns.  Ponzi Scheme According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk.  The Ponzi scheme is a classic scam and incorporates components of other scams as well.  The investment proceeds in this classic scam are simply the new investors' monies doled out to existing clients.  So how do I know if its a scam?

    "R02196": "Authorities (or sometimes whistleblowers on the inside) find out about the scheme and stop it. The scheme was named after a man named Charles Ponzi.  He used the scheme after moving from Italy to the United States in 1903.  (Ponzi didn't invent the scheme, though.  In 1857, Charles Dickens wrote a book called Little Dorrit about a scheme like this.  The scheme is a simple idea, and probably very old.)  However, Ponzi's scheme was so big that it became the most popular.  His original scheme was based on using countries' money-exchange rates to make money, based on international postage stamps.  But money soon stopped being invested in coupons, and went to early investors, and a lot to Ponzi himself.  Ponzi schemes can be run anywhere, even online, and are being run even now.

Examples are: Hedge Futures Trading (taking a good risk) High-yield investment programs (gives you back a lot of money) Offshore Investment (makes money easily in other countries) Schemers often depend on investors not actually knowing about economics.

Clients have failures to receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out their investments.  Ponzi scheme promoters routinely encourage participants to roll over investments and sometimes promise even higher returns on the amount rolled over.   Section::::Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme.   If a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities, it usually falls apart for one of the following reasons:  BULLET::::1.  The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money.   BULLET::::2.  Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).

However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a hub for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.  A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.  A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.  By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.  Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes.  For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method, known as  smart Ponzis  per the Financial Times.

What makes Argentinian wine so famous, rich, and flavorful?  The reason for the popularity of Argentinas wine can be found in its production and growing techniques.  A majority of the grapes grown in Argentina come from Mendoza.  The low rainfall and dry conditions in Mendoza are ideal for growing grapes that are rot and insect-free that would otherwise ruin the grapevines.  Additionally, the rocky soil has a tendency to stress the grapes, so they produce fewer grapes, but with a higher flavor content.  With new technology and techniques for harvesting, wine production in Argentina has increased.  Argentina is the fifth-largest wine producer in the world.  Grapevines were originally brought to Argentina in the mid 16th century by Spanish missionaries and conquistadors.  #7 Iguazu Falls Argentina is famous for Iguazu Falls, one of the seven Natural Wonders of the World.

Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  Its because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Lets elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  Its a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceXs Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable. Because of all these reasons, SpaceX chose rocket grade Kerosene for their Falcon rockets.

    "R02220": "But when Methane wants to bond with a suitable other atom including another methane, then it donates its hydrogen/hydrogens to the acceptor and each time it donates a hydrogen, it becomes protonated and the proton forms a bond. And depending on how many protons (hydrogens) it donates, it loses a hydrogen in reality and in formula and becomes CH3 or CH2 or CH or just C on losing 1,2,3 or 4 hydrogens respectively.  Similarly, methane as an acceptor too forms the same CH3, CH2, CH if it has accepted 3, 2 or one hydrogen atoms respectively.  In both cases donation or acceptance, methane has to be a complete methane i.e., CH4 during bonding instead a methyl group, methylene group, or CH group or just C during bonding and hence bonds in such a way that all four Hydrogen atoms are satisfied at all times by forming a single bond in case of CH3 group, double bond in case of CH2 group, triple bond in case of CH group or accepts all four hydrogens in case of C group by forming two double bonds or a triple bond and a single bond.

Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which damages the environment, makes work around the launch pad difficult, and makes getting a launch license that much more difficult.  The rocket exhaust is also ionized, which would interfere with radio communication with the rocket.  Nuclear thermal rocket engines differ from conventional rocket engines in that energy is supplied to the propellants by an external nuclear heat source instead of the heat of combustion.  The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing liquid hydrogen gas through an operating nuclear reactor.  Testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulses of about 850 seconds (8,340 m/s), about twice that of the Space Shuttle engines.  A variety of other rocket propulsion methods, such as ion thrusters, give much higher specific impulse but with much lower thrust; for example the Hall effect thruster on the SMART-1 satellite has a specific impulse of 1,640 s (16,100 m/s) but a maximum thrust of only 68 millinewtons.

Origin of Liquid Propellants 1903  The liquid propellants that are used within the early development of Robert H. Goddard rocket launch were proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903.   Section::::History.:World  War II era.   Germany had very active rocket development before and during World War II, both for the strategic V-2 rocket and other missiles.  The V-2 used an alcohol/LOX liquid propellant engine, with hydrogen peroxide to drive the fuel pumps.  The alcohol was mixed with water for engine cooling.  Both Germany and the United States developed reusable liquid propellant rocket engines that used a storeable liquid oxidizer with much greater density than LOX and a liquid fuel that ignited spontaneously on contact with the high density oxidizer.  The German engine was powered by hydrogen peroxide and a fuel mixture of hydrazine hydrate and methyl alcohol.  The U.S. engine was powered by nitric acid oxidizer and aniline.

Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded.  Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling.  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is thrown away this type of engine is also known as open cycle .  There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.  The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.

The impact of climate change can be marked by mass coral bleaching events, which occur when reefs are under stress from rising sea temperatures.  The latest global mass coral bleaching event is responsible for the worst coral die-off ever recorded.  Scientists predict that within 30 years the planet could face a complete collapse of the coral reef ecosystem, including the loss of thousands of species of fish and other important organisms.  Loss of coral reefs poses a threat to the ecosystem as well as to livelihoods connected to oceans.  The over-exploitation of fisheries, coastal development, and pollution has had serious impacts on coral reefs.  In some places, reefs have been entirely destroyed, while in others they are a pale shadow of what they once were.  The threat of climate change has added an increasing burden and is now considered to be the number one threat to the future of coral reefs.  Despite their importance, coral reefs are facing ecological extinction.

For example, degraded reefs are less productive and may not be able to sustain accretion rates necessary to ensure reefs continue to provide shoreline protection services.  Reefs damaged by coral bleaching can quickly lose many of the features that underpin the aesthetic appeal that is fundamental to reef tourism.  The resultant loss of revenue from reduced tourist activity can threaten the livelihoods of local communities.  Coral bleaching events that lead to significant coral mortality can drive large shifts in fish communities.  This can translate into reduced catches for fishers targeting reef fish species, which in turn leads to impacts on food supply and associated economic activities.

Though his film distribution rights were at one point owned by Universal and the rights situation around him is still murky, hes one of the most prominent and long-running Avengers in the comics, and also a really great character.  He was slated to first appear in a book called Motion Picture Funnies Weekly, but that issue was never released and thus Namor McKenzie first appeared in the legendary Marvel Comics #1 in 1939.  He predates DCs Aquaman by two years and like the orange-scaled Justice Leaguer, Namor is the son of a human man and an Atlantean princess.  Namor would be a great chance for Marvel to cast a South-Asian actor in a lead role, and would make a truly great addition to the MCU.

This character was a minor character and basically a one-off though.  She disappeared soon after her debut, never to be heard from again.  She did not have the same sensational public response that Wonder Woman did.  Wonder Woman was introduced in All Star Comics #8 (December 1941), during the era known to comics historians as the Golden Age of Comic Books.  Following this debut, which got a huge response from the public, she was featured in Sensation Comics #1 (January 1942), and six months later appeared in her own comic book series (Summer 1942).

According to Google in 2010, black girls were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?

Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes.  Lets take a deeper look.  The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons.  By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted.  The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms.  2 ^2  2   Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased.  An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases.  For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image.  That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.  3 ^3  3   Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context.  Hiring algorithms especially fall victim to racial bias due to automation.

This included the break-in at the Democratic party headquarters by Nixon associates to sabotage political opponents.  There were also taped conversations that Nixon refused to release to investigators that were thought to reveal his knowledge of the corruption and wrongdoing within his administration.  Nixon resigned in order to avoid the disgrace of a trial and subsequent removal from office.  His vice president, Gerald Ford, took office after him and soon gave Nixon a full pardon for his wrongdoing.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.  The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.",
    "R02260": "Watergate scandal. Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.  Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the 1976 presidential election against Jimmy Carter.   In 1977, Nixon arranged an interview with British journalist David Frost in the hopes of improving his legacy.  Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions.  The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.  The 2008 movie, Frost/Nixon (film) is a media depiction of this.   In the aftermath of Watergate, \"follow the money\" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein.  The phrase was never used in the 1974 book \"All the President's Men\" and did not become associated with it until the movie of the same name was released in 1976.  The 2017 movie, , is about Mark Felt's role in the Watergate scandal and his identity of being Deep Throat.   The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands.

Differences and similarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme The similarity between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme is that past \"investors\" (current retirees) are seen as being paid from funds collected from current \"investors\" (future retirees).  The other similarity is that people are discouraged from withdrawal by promising higher returns if they withdraw later.  It may be argued that a third similarity is that there is really no \"account\" for every individual with money in it.  Social Security benefits are calculated using a complex formula and not based solely on the individual's contributions during their working years.

By the end of the 20th century, the tango had lost some of its appeal among the nations youth, who generally preferred dancing to rock and pop music in local discotheques; nevertheless, it has remained popular among the older generation and foreigners and has continued to evolve under the influence of such artists as Astor Piazzolla and Roberto Fripo.

NASA doesn't use enough rockets to make reusability worthwhile.  Reusable rockets are only valuable if the frequency of launches is great enough to outweigh the cost of developing and utilizing the technology.  It would have been silly to waste Apollo project funds trying to make the Saturn V reusable.  Only about a dozen launches of the Saturn V were planned, so it was cheaper to use a disposable launch vehicle.  When it came time for the Space Shuttle, NASA did plan to do many and frequent launches, so the Orbiter and the Solid Rocket Boosters were designed to be reusable.  It wasn't deemed worthwhile to make the External Tank reusable.  Although the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) were reusable and going to be used on the SLS rocket, NASA doesn't plan to reuse them.  The refurbishing and recertification costs make reuse more expensive than manufacturing new engines.  The French and the Russians did, at one time, work together in an attempt to make the Ariane 5 reusable, but the hardware that would be needed to support the return of the vehicle became too large to make the effort worthwhile.  Making a launch vehicle reusable is very difficult.",
    "R02277": "Gas-generator cycle.  Gas-generator cycle  The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as open cycle.   There are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the staged combustion cycle.  The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber.  This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.   The main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant.  Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.  However, there are forms of the gas-generator cycle that recycle the exhaust into the nozzle of the rocket engine.  This is seen in the F-1 rocket engine used on the Saturn V booster stage.   As in most cryogenic rocket engines, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling).",

A recent scientific report on corals in the Caribbean Sea, for instance, found that coral cover declined from 34.8 percent to 16.3 percent from 1970 to 2012.  One of the chief threats to corals is climate change.  Not only do warmer waters stress the species, leading to bleaching events like the one pictured above.  Climate change provides a double blow to corals because it also brings on ocean acidification, driven by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (caused by the burning of fossil fuels) dissolved in seawater.  As sea waters acidify, corals have a harder time producing calcium carbonate, which is crucial to reef formation.  Thats why, in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology now tentatively propose something that they admit is extremely novel in conservation circles.  Namely, they suggest that humans may need to intervene in the breeding of corals so as to assist their evolution.
